Oh lawd, doc! Ma chest be hurtin' somethin' fierce. Can't hardly breathe, neither. This pain... ain't never felt nothin' like it before. It be like a 8 on that there 10-point scale y'all use. It be gettin' worse when I try to breathe. I can't hardly talk no more.
Ain't had no procedures, doc. But I been dealin' with this here emphysema and asthma for a good long while now. Ain't never had nothin' like this before though.
Doc, I ain't even sure. I be so out of it right now. My coworker might know... he be around here somewhere. He the one brought me in. I can't remember nothin' right now with this pain.
Doc, I ain't got no allergies that I know of. Ain't nothin' I done come across that bother me yet.
Naw doc, ain't been nowhere. Just been workin' at the trucking company. Ain't had no time for no travelin'.
Naw, doc. Ain't nobody at the job been sick or nothin'. We all been keepin' our distance, doin' that social distancin' thing.
