As the patient's coworker, I can tell you he suddenly started experiencing sharp pain in the right side of his chest and had severe difficulty breathing. We quickly called an ambulance and he was given oxygen during transport. He hasn't had something like this happen before, but he's had emphysema and asthma for many years. He's unable to answer questions right now due to the pain and difficulty breathing.
As far as I know, he hasn't had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. However, he's been dealing with emphysema and asthma for many years.
I'm not sure about all his medications, but I know he uses an inhaler for his asthma and emphysema. I'm not sure about any other medications or supplements.
I'm sorry, but I don't know about any allergies he might have. He's never mentioned any to me.
As his coworker, I can tell you that he hasn't been traveling recently. Most of our work is local and he hasn't taken any time off for vacations.
I can't be certain, but as far as I know, he hasn't been around anyone who's been ill recently at work.
