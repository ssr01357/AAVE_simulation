Doctor, my knees be hurtin' real bad and they all swollen up. Been like this for about a week now. Everyday it seem to be gettin' worse. I be strugglin' to get my kids ready for school in the mornin' and all. It's really messin' with my life, you know?
Nah, doctor, ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. Last major thing was childbirth, that was a year ago. No other medical problems either, I've been healthy. Just this pain and swelling recently.
Just the oral contraceptives, doc. I been takin' some Acetaminophen for the pain too, but it ain't helpin' much. Ain't takin' no other stuff, no herbal supplements or nothin'.
I ain't got no allergies, doc. Never had no problems with that.
Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. Just been takin' care of my business and my family, you know? Ain't had no time for travelin'.
No, I ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick, doc. Ain't had no infectious exposures. My kids been healthy, my husband too. We all been good, 'cept for my knees.
