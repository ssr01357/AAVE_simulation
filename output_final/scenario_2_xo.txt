My boy been having trouble breathin' and he been wheezin' too these past 3 days. His cough been getting bad too. He cough more after he done play outside.
Nah, he ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. But he been hospitalized once when he was 2 for the same breathin' and coughing thing. They gave him them IV antibiotics and oxygen, too. He also had them tubes put in his ears when he was a baby. But ain't nothing else happen in the last 12 months.
He be on a steroid cream for his skin. It be itchy, you know, atopic dermatitis. But he don't take nothing else, no over-the-counter or herbal stuff.
Pollen be the thing that bothers him, makes his eyes all watery and itchy. But that's the only thing he got allergy to.
Nah, we ain't been nowhere recently. We been stayin' put, just at home and him playin' in the backyard.
Nah, he ain't been around nobody who be sick. We be careful 'bout that, especially with his breathin' problems.
