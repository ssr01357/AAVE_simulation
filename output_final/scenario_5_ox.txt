Hey Doc, it's been tough, ya know. I been havin' this knee pain, and it's been swellin' up too, like real bad this past week. It's been real hard to manage, ya know.
Nah, Doc, ain't been nothin' like that. Only time I been in a hospital was when I had my babies. No other medical problems, thank God. Just this pain and stiffness lately, ya know.
Yes, Doc. I'm on the pill, oral contraceptives, ya know. And I been takin' some acetaminophen for this pain but it ain't doin' much, barely takes it down to a 4. Ain't usin' no other stuff.
Ain't got no allergies, Doc. None that I know of anyway.
Nah, Doc. Ain't been nowhere. Been too tired and achy to go much of anywhere, truth be told.
Nah, Doc. Ain't none of my family or friends been sick lately. No known infectious exposures, ya know.
