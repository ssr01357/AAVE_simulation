Well, doc, my girl here been feelin' real bad. She been throwin' up and feelin' all nauseous. Then she started feelin' all tired and out of it. Couldn't get her to eat nothin' yesterday. She a diabetic, type 1, and she ain't had her insulin in a day now. She ain't been complainin' about no belly pain or diarrhea or nothin' like that though. She did say she felt some chills yesterday. She ain't much of a drinker and don't use no other drugs or nothin'.
Nah, doc. Ain't nothin' like that. Just her diabetes, you know? She be takin' her insulin multiple times a day. But other than that, she been good. No other illnesses or procedures. I ain't privy to her whole medical history though.
Nah, doc, ain't nothin' like that. She just be takin' her insulin for her diabetes. That's it. No other meds or herbal stuff. But she ain't had none of her insulin for the past 24 hours. She don't do no other drugs or substances either.
I ain't got no idea if she got any allergies, doc. Ain't somethin' we ever talked about. I'm sorry I can't be more help with that. We just roommates, you know?
Nah, doc. She ain't been nowhere recently. Been workin' a lot, you know? She works in advertising sales, keeps her pretty busy. Ain't been no time for travel or nothin' like that.
Oh, I ain't too sure 'bout that, doc. We ain't been around each other much, you know? She been workin' a lot and all. But as far as I know, she ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick.
