Well, Doc, I ain't too sure. My man found me havin' a seizure 'n then I passed out. I been havin' this terrible headache for days, and my feet been all swole up. I ain't never had nothin' like this happen before. I'm all confused 'n stuff.
Nah, Doc, ain't had no hospital stays or procedures. Ain't been sick neither, 'cept for this here pregnancy. All been smooth sailin', till now that is.
Just them prenatal vitamins, Doc. Ain't been takin' nothin' else, no over-the-counter stuff or herbal things. Just tryin' to keep me 'n my baby healthy.
Ain't got no allergies, Doc. Not that I know of, at least.
Nah, Doc. Ain't had no travels. I been stayin' close to home, specially with the baby on the way.
Nah, Doc, ain't been around nobody who's sick. Been keepin' to myself mostly, tryin' to stay healthy for the baby.
