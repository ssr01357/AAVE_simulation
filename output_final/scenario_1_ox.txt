Doc, I been feelin' this awful sharp pain on my left side of my chest. It hit me 'bout 45 minutes ago and it ain't let up yet. I'm tellin' ya, it's a solid 8 on a scale of 10. It's got me feelin' short of breath and a little queasy. But, ain't no fever, chills, cough, or anything like that. It's just this dang pain.
Nah, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses this past year. Ain't been in no hospital since I had my babies, and they all grown up now. Only thing I got is my high blood pressure, but I been takin' my meds like I supposed to.
Yeah, I'm on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure. I been takin' 'em for about 5 years now. But other than that, I ain't takin' nothin' else, no over-the-counter stuff or herbal things.
I ain't got no allergies, doc. Ain't never had no problems with no drugs or no foods or nothin'.
Nah, doc. I ain't been nowhere recently. I mostly just stick around here, playin' my bridge and takin' my daily walks. Ain't no big traveler.
Nah, doc. Ain't nobody I know been sick lately. I'm usually pretty careful 'bout that stuff, especially with all this virus goin' around. I been keepin' my distance, wearin' my mask and all.
