Mother: My son has been having shortness of breath and wheezing for the past 3 days. His cough is also getting worse. I've noticed that he tends to cough more after he plays outside, especially in our backyard.
Mother: No, he hasn't had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. But when he was 2 years old, he was hospitalized for a week for similar symptoms. They gave him IV antibiotics and oxygen by face mask. He also had pressure equalization tubes inserted when he was 18 months old.
Mother: He's only using a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. He's not taking anything else.
Mother: He's allergic to pollen. It causes his eyes to water and itch.
Mother: No, we haven't traveled anywhere recently. We've been mostly staying at home.
Mother: Not that I know of. We've been very careful about who he comes into contact with, especially with his breathing problems.
