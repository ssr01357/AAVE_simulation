Knee pain, it be bad. Got swelling too. Been having it for about a week now.
No, ain't had no illnesses or procedures. Only been in hospital for childbirth, that done was a while ago though. Last one was when I was 31, got three kids now. Ain't had no other medical problems.
Yeah, I be on the pill. Ain't taking nothing else but that and some acetaminophen for this knee pain. Don't do much though, just takes the edge off a little bit. Pain still be at a 4 on a scale of 10, even with the acetaminophen.
Ain't got no allergies that I know of.
No, ain't been nowhere recently. Been too tired and weak, mostly staying home. Plus, with these aches and stiffness, traveling ain't really on my mind.
No, ain't been around nobody who's sick. I been keeping my children and myself pretty much to ourselves. Don't want to catch nothing, you know?
