Well, my little boy, he been havin' some trouble breathing, you see. Been wheezin' more'n more these past few days. He been coughin' too, seem like it getting worse, especially after he done playin' outside. I been noticin' that he often be wheezin' after playin' in our backyard, but it usually get better once he inside. This ain't the first time either, he been hospitalized when he was 2 for the same thing. But he ain't got no fever or nothin' like that, and he ain't be coughin' up no mucus or anything.
Nah, he ain't had no procedures or nothin' in the past year. Only thing he got is this skin condition, atopic dermatitis. He be usin' a steroid cream for that. But other than that, he been good, no other medical problems. He been sick before though, had that "wheezy bronchitis" as a baby a lot, and them ear infections. Even had tubes put in when he was 18 months. But ain't nothing major in the last year, no.
He ain't on no medication, 'cept for that steroid cream for his skin, that atopic dermatitis. Other than that, he ain't takin' nothin', no over-the-counter or herbal stuff. He just be usin' that cream.
My boy, he be allergic to pollen. It be causin' his eyes to water and itch. But that's it, ain't got no other allergies that we know of.
Nah, we ain't been nowhere recently. We just been stayin' at home, mostly. Ain't been no travelin'.
Nah, ain't nobody been sick around him. We been keepin' him away from folks who be feelin' under the weather. Ain't had no exposure to sick people.
