Well, Doc, my lil' boy been havin' some real trouble breathin' these past few days. He been wheezin' and his cough been gettin' worse. Seems like it always get worse after he been playin' outside. He been through this before, had to stay in the hospital for it when he was just 2. I'm just real worried about him, Doc.
No, not really Doc. Ain't been nothin' major the past year. Just him wheezin' after playin' outside, but it usually gets better once he come inside. But this time, it ain't gettin' no better. He been havin' this shortness of breath and cough for the past 3 days. Ain't no fever, chills, earache, swollen glands, or sore throat. He ain't coughin' up no mucus either. But when he was a baby, he did have a whole lot of wheezy bronchitis and ear infections. They had to put tubes in his ears when he was 18 months.
Only thing he been usin' is a steroid cream, Doc. That's for his atopic dermatitis. But ain't no other medications or supplements. He a healthy boy otherwise, just got this breathin' problem that's gettin' me real worried.
My baby got this allergy to pollen, Doc. Makes his eyes all watery and itchy. But other than that, ain't no other allergies we know of.
Nah, Doc. We ain't been nowhere recently. Just been stayin' around the house, you know? He just been playin' in the backyard like he always do.
No, Doc, ain't no one been sick around us recently. We been keepin' to ourselves, ain't been around no one who been ill.
