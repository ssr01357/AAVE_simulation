Coworker: Doc, my man here ain't able to talk much right now. But he had this god awful sharp chest pain kick in while we was at work and he's having a hard time breathing. It's bad, doc, like an 8 outta 10 bad. It seemed to get worse when he was trying to breathe. He's been dealing with emphysema and asthma for years, but I ain't never seen him like this before.
Coworker: Nah, doc. Just his usual emphysema and asthma stuff. No major illnesses or procedures that I know of.
Coworker: You know, I ain't exactly sure what he's on for his emphysema and asthma. But as far as I know, he ain't been taking no herbs or over-the-counter stuff. We can probably get that info from his regular doctor, though.
Coworker: I ain't sure about that either, doc. He never mentioned no allergies to me. But again, his regular doctor would probably know about that.
Coworker: Nah, doc. He ain't been nowhere. We've been working steady at the trucking company. Ain't had no time for traveling.
Coworker: Not that I know of, doc. We been keeping our distance 'cause of that Covid thing. Ain't nobody at the company been sick neither.
