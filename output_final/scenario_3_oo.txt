My roomie done brought me in 'cause I been feelin' real sick. Been throwin' up and ain't had no energy. Can't even stand up straight, doc.
Nah, doc, ain't had nothin' like that. Just got my diabetes, ya know. Be takin' my insulin every day, but ain't had none in the past day 'cause of all this sickness. Ain't been able to keep nothin' down. No procedures or anythin' else though.
Just be takin' my insulin for my diabetes, doc. Ain't been on nothin' else, no over-the-counter stuff or them herbal things. But ain't had my insulin in a day 'cause I been too sick to take it.
Ain't got no allergies that I know of, doc. Never had no trouble with that.
No, doc, ain't been nowhere recently. Just been stayin' home mostly, workin' and such. Ain't had no travels.
Nah, doc, ain't been 'round nobody who's sick that I know of. Just been me and my roomie, and she ain't been sick.
