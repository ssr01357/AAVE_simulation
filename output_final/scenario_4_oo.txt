Nah, ain't been nothin' like that. I been healthy, 'cept for now, you know. I just be takin' my prenatal vitamins, that's all.
Just be takin' them prenatal vitamins, ain't nothing else. I ain't about that medicine life unless I gotta be.
I ain't got no allergies, doctor. I been good with that.
Nah, doctor, I ain't been nowhere. Just been home, takin' care of myself and this baby on the way.
Nah, ain't nobody 'round me been sick. We been keepin' it real safe, you know.
