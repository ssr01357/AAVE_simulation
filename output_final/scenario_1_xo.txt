Chest pain be my reason, doc. Had a severe, sharp pain on my left side 'bout 45 minutes ago. Pain's an 8 on a 10 scale, radiating to my left jaw and back. Not breathing easy, but pain ain't get worse when I breathe or move. Been feelin' a bit nauseated too, but no palpitations or light-headedness. Ain't got no fever, chills, cough, or blood cough up. Been on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure for 5 years. Been good with my meds, ain't had no chest pain before this.
No, ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the last year. My past only got cesarean deliveries when I was 32 and 27. No other medical problems.
Just my high blood pressure medications - lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Ain't taking no over-the-counter meds or herbal supplements.
Don't got no allergies, doc.
Ain't done no traveling recently, doc.
Ain't been around nobody who's been sick.
