Well Doc, I be havin' this real bad pain in my chest, on the left side. It done started about 45 minutes ago, outta nowhere. It's sharp, and it be radiating to my left jaw and back. I'm feelin' a bit short of breath and kinda nauseous, but ain't got no fever or chills. Ain't been coughing, ain't spat any blood. This pain, it don't get worse when I breathe or move around. It's the first time I had somethin' like this. I been keepin' up with my hypertension meds too, ain't missed none.
Nah, doc, ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. I been pretty healthy, 'cept for this hypertension thing that I been dealin' with for 'bout 5 years now. Only thing significant in my past be them cesarean deliveries I had when I was 32 and again at 27. Other than that, I been good.
Yeah, I be takin' lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my hypertension. I been takin' 'em religiously for the past 5 years. But other than that, I ain't on no other meds or supplements, over-the-counter or herbal. I be keepin' it simple, doc.
Ain't got no allergies, doc. I be good with all that. Ain't nothing that I know of that be causin' me trouble.
Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I be mostly home, just doin' my thing, playin' my bridge tournaments and takin' my daily walks. Ain't been travelin' much since my husband passed. It be mostly just me, doin' my thing.
Nah, doc. Ain't nobody around me been sick. My kids, they come visit me, but they been healthy. And my bridge partners, they all be lookin' good too. So, no, ain't been 'round nobody who's sick.
