I started having this severe left-sided chest pain about 45 minutes ago. It’s really sharp and I would rate it as an 8 on a scale of 10. The pain is also radiating to my left jaw and to my back. I feel mildly short of breath but the pain doesn't get worse when I breathe or change my body position. I also feel a bit nauseous but I don’t have any palpitations or light-headedness. I have not had any fever, chills, cough, or blood in my spit.
