Chest pain, doctor. And can't breathe right, it be really bad. Pain on right side of chest...hurts more when I breathe. Never been like this before. Been workin' at trucking company...pain started there, outta nowhere. Got emphysema and asthma, been havin' 'em for years. Ain't nothin' like this happened before.
I can't recall nothin' in past year. Been dealin' with emphysema and asthma for a while, but nothin' else. No procedures or nothin'. It's just this pain now. Done got me worried... ain't been in this kind of distress before.
Been on medication for my emphysema and asthma. But nothin' over-the-counter or herbs. Just what the doctor had prescribed for me. They be workin' alright till now. This pain ain't nothin' I done experienced before. Hurtin' real bad.
Ain't got no allergies, doctor. Not to medicine, food, or nothin'. Been that way all my life. This pain, it's somethin' different, ain't never felt nothin' like it before. It's real bad, doctor.
Ain't been nowhere. Just been workin'. Ain't had no time for no travel. Just been at the trucking company. Ain't never had a problem like this before, just this sharp pain outta nowhere.
No, ain't been around nobody sick. Just been workin'. Ain't seen no one at work been sick either. This just come on real sudden, ain't never felt nothin' like it before.
