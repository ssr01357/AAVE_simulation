I've been feeling really unwell. I've been nauseous and vomiting for the past 24 hours. It's gotten to the point where I'm now feeling drowsy and lethargic. I couldn't even eat anything yesterday because of how bad the nausea and vomiting was.
As far as I'm aware, no. I haven't had any procedures recently. The only major health condition I have is type 1 diabetes. I usually take insulin multiple times a day, but I haven't had any in the past 24 hours because of the vomiting and nausea.

I'm not aware of any allergies that I have.
No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently.
Not that I know of. I haven't been in close contact with anyone who's been visibly ill.
