As her roommate, I brought her in because she's been feeling nauseous and has been vomiting for the past 24 hours. She hasn't eaten anything yesterday due to this. Over the past hour, she's become drowsy and lethargic. She also mentioned having chills yesterday.
As far as I know, she hasn't had any procedures or major illnesses in the past year. However, she does have type 1 diabetes and takes insulin multiple times a day. She hasn't taken any insulin in the past 24 hours though.
She usually takes insulin multiple times daily for her type 1 diabetes. However, she hasn't had any insulin during the past 24 hours because of her nausea and vomiting. To my knowledge, she doesn't take any other medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements.
I'm afraid I'm not aware of any allergies that she might have. Her medical history is largely unobtainable at the moment due to her condition.
I'm not aware of any recent travels. She's been mostly at home due to her work as an advertising sales representative.
I'm not sure about that. We haven't had any visitors recently and she hasn't mentioned being in contact with someone who's sick.
