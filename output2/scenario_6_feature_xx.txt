As his coworker, I can tell you that he suddenly developed a sharp pain in his right chest and started having trouble breathing. He's in so much pain that he can't really talk right now. He's never had this happen before, but he does have a history of emphysema and asthma.
I'm not aware of any procedures or major illnesses in the past year. He's been managing his emphysema and asthma, but nothing beyond that to my knowledge.
I'm sorry, but as his coworker, I'm not sure about his medications or any supplements he might be taking. He's never mentioned anything about it to me.
I'm sorry, but I don't know if he has any allergies. He's never mentioned anything about that to me.
Not that I'm aware of. He mostly stays local due to his job at the trucking company. I haven't heard him mention any recent travels.
I'm not sure, doctor. We work in a large company and people come and go. He hasn't mentioned being around anyone who's been sick though.
