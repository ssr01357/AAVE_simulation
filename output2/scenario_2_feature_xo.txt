Well, my little boy here, he ain't been feelin' too great. He's been strugglin' with breathin' and he be wheezin' for the past 3 days. His cough, it ain't gettin' no better. Mostly, he coughs more when he's out playin' outside.
No, ain't nothing like that happened. He ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. But, when he was just 2, he done had to stay in the hospital for a week because of similar symptoms. They gave him some IV antibiotics and oxygen then. He's been healthy since then. He's been havin' this cough and wheeze issue for a while now, but it usually gets better when he comes inside from playin'. But it ain't been improving these last few days. That's what got us worried.
He ain't takin' nothin' but this steroid cream for his skin. He got this thing called atopic dermatitis. He ain't on no other medicine or supplement.
Well, he got this allergy to pollen. It make his eyes all water and itch. Other than that, ain't no other allergies we know about.
No, he ain't gone nowhere recently. We been steady at home, ain't been no travelin'.
No, he ain't been around nobody who's been sick. We been careful 'bout that, especially with all this virus goin' 'round. Ain't nobody in the family been sick either.
