Oh Lord, I dunno exactly. My man said I had a seizure or somethin', then I passed out cold. I remember havin' this bad headache though, it's been botherin' me for days. My feet been all swollen too.
Nah, Doctor, ain't nothing like that. Ain't never been hospitalized or had no big sickness. Just been takin' my prenatal vitamins, you know, for the baby.
Nothin' else but my prenatal vitamins, Doc. Don't do no other drugs or supplements. Just tryna stay healthy for my baby, you know.
Ain't got no allergies, Doc. At least, none that I know of.
Nah, ain't been nowhere recently, Doc. Just been stayin' close to home, especially with this baby comin' soon.
Nah, Doc, I ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick. I been tryna keep myself safe and all, especially with the baby and all.
