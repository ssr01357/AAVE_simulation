Well, doc, I been feelin' this bad pain in my chest, on the left side. It started all sudden-like about 45 minutes ago, and it's sharp, like an 8 on that scale of 10 yâ€™all use. The pain been movin' to my left jaw and my back too. Got me some shortness of breath, but it don't get worse when I breathe or move. Feelin' a bit nauseous too but ain't been havin' no palpitations or light-headedness. Ain't had no fever, chills, cough, or nothin' like that. I been takin' my blood pressure medicine, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, just like I'm supposed to. Ain't never had no chest pain like this before, not at rest, not when I'm workin' out, nothin'.
Nah, doc. Ain't had no hospital stays or procedures. Ain't been sick or nothin' in the past year. Just been takin' my blood pressure meds like I'm supposed to. I did have two cesarean deliveries, but that was way back when I was 32 and 27. Ain't had no other medical problems.
Yeah, doc, I'm takin' lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure. Been on it for about 5 years now. But I ain't takin' no other meds, no over-the-counter stuff or herbal things. I been good 'bout takin' my meds like I'm supposed to.
Ain't got no allergies, doc. Never had none.
Nah, doc, ain't been nowhere recently. I been steady at home, just doin' my regular stuff, playin' bridge, walkin' my usual 2 to 3 miles a day. Ain't traveled no place.
Nah, doc. Ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick. Just been keepin' to myself, doin' my usual. Ain't been exposed to no sick folks.
