My husband done brought me in here, doc. I ain't never had no seizure before, but he say he seen me havin' one. Done scared us both. I be confused now and I been havin' this awful headache for days. My feet ain't lookin' right neither, been swollen for weeks.
No, ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. Been pretty healthy, 'specially since I found out I was pregnant. Just been takin' my prenatal vitamins like I supposed to.
Ain't takin' nothin' but them prenatal vitamins doctor gave me. No other meds, no herbal stuff. Just tryin' to keep my baby healthy, you know?
Ain't got no allergies, doc. Not to medicines, foods, nothin'. I been lucky like that.
Nah, ain't been nowhere. Just been home, work, and my prenatal check-ups. Ain't had no time for travelin', what with the baby comin' and all.
Nah, ain't been 'round nobody sick. I be workin' as a nursing assistant but we careful there. I ain't caught nothin'.
