Ain't no way to get around it, doc. Chest is hurtin' somethin' fierce, can't hardly breathe. Pain's steady comin' on the right side of the chest. Never ain't had nothin' like this before.
Ain't had no procedures, ain't been no major illnesses these past months. Just the usual emphysema and asthma that I been dealin' with. They been around for years, they has. But ain't nothin' like what's happenin' now.
Ain't on nothin' fancy. Just the regular meds for my emphysema and asthma. Ain't no other meds or supplements I be taking.
Ain't got no allergies that I know of, doc. Never had no reactions to no meds neither.
Ain't been nowhere recently. Just been steady workin' at the trucking company. Ain't had no time for no travellin'.
Ain't nobody I work with been sick that I know of. Been keepin' to myself mostly. Ain't been around no one sick.
