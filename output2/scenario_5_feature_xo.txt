Well, Doc, it ain't nothing but my knees. They been causing me some real pain and got all swelled up this past week. Ain't getting no relief, no matter what I try.
Ain't been no procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. Last time I been in a hospital was for childbirth, and that was a year ago. Other than that, ain't had no medical problems.
I'm taking an oral contraceptive, but that's it. Tried acetaminophen for the pain, but it ain't working. No herbal supplements or nothing.
Ain't got no allergies that I know of. Never had no bad reaction to no medicines or foods or nothing.
Nah, ain't been nowhere recently. Just been staying close to home, taking care of my family and my small business. Just ain't had the time or energy for traveling, not with this pain and swelling.
Ain't been around nobody who's been sick, no. I ain't been exposed to no known infectious stuff. My kids is healthy, my husband's healthy. Ain't nobody been sick.
