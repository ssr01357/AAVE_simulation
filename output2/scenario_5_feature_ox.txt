Well doc, these knees of mine been givin' me a whole heap of trouble. They been swellin' up and hurtin' somethin' fierce these past few days. It's been hard, you know, to take care of my family and all. I been feelin' real tired and weak too, for about four months now. And the stiffness, oh lawd, the stiffness! It's worst in the mornin', last bout an hour or two. Makes it hard to get the kids off to school. I also been havin' some pain and swellin' in my wrists and hands for about a month. I tried takin' some acetaminophen but it ain't doin' much good. The pain just drops from a 5 to a 4. Don't seem to be no fever or night sweats though. Ain't been exposed to nothin' infectious that I know of. Oh, and my libido's been low for about the same time I been feelin' tired.
Nah, doc. Ain't been nothin' like that. Last time I was in a hospital was when I had my youngest, and that was over a year ago. I ain't been sick or nothin'. Only thing I take regularly is my birth control pills. I ain't got no allergies and my vaccinations are all up to date. My pops got hypertension and my momma's got type 2 diabetes, but I ain't got none of that. I'm generally healthy, doc. This pain and stiffness is really new and botherin' me.
Just the birth control pills, doc. I tried takin' some acetaminophen for the pain, but it ain't been workin' too good. Other than that, I ain't on nothin'. I don't smoke or drink, and I sure don't use no other substances. I try to keep things natural, you know?
I ain't got no allergies, doc. Not that I know of anyhow. Never had no problems with medications or foods or nothin'.
Nah, doc. I ain't been nowhere recently. Been too busy with the kids and the business, you know? Plus, with all this pain and fatigue, I ain't really been feelin' up to travelin'.
Nah, doc. Can't say I have. Ain't nobody in my family been sick, and I ain't been around no one else who's been ill either. It's just this here pain and stiffness, and the fatigue that's been botherin' me.
