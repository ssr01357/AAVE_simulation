I come in today 'cause of this real bad pain in my chest, on my left side. Ain't never had no pain like this before. It's a sharp, stabbing kind of pain. Feels like an 8 out of 10. It be done started about 45 minutes ago. The pain, it be radiating to my left jaw and my back. I ain't got no fever, chills, cough, or blood in my spit. I been taking my blood pressure medicines like I should, ain't missed a dose. No chest pain before this, not at rest, not when I move around.
Ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. I been keeping myself just fine, doc. Only been to the hospital for having my babies, and that was a good while ago. No other medical problems, just my blood pressure. Been taking my lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for that. Ain't got no allergies either. I keep up with my shots, they all done. Been healthy, till now.
Yes, I is taking my lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure. Been on them for about 5 years now. But I ain't taking no over-the-counter or herbal supplements. Just my blood pressure medicines, that's all.
I ain't got no allergies, doc. Ain't never had any reactions to no medicines or foods or nothing.
No, ain't been nowhere recently. Just been staying at home mostly, with this pandemic and all.
Ain't been around nobody who's been sick. I been keeping myself safe, staying away from folks as much as I can.
