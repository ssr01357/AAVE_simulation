I'm his coworker, doc. My man here, he started havin' this real bad chest pain, right here on the right side. Ain't never seen him like this before. He strugglin' to breathe too. He got emphysema and asthma for a long time now but this, this is somethin' else. We gave him some oxygen on the way here.
Nah, doc, not that I know of. He been dealin' with his emphysema and asthma, but nothing else major, no surgeries or anything like that. You know, he always been pretty sturdy, just this breathing thing been holdin' him back.
Well, he got his inhaler he use for his asthma and emphysema, but I ain't too sure about other meds. He ain't the type to pop pills much. As for herbal stuff, I ain't heard him mention nothin' like that. You know, he mostly just work and try to keep his breathin' in check.
To my knowledge, doc, he don't got no allergies. But like I said, I'm just his coworker, not family or nothin'. He never mentioned anything 'bout allergies to me.
No, sir, he ain't been nowhere. He just been workin'. He's a truck driver, but he ain't been outta state or nothin'. Just local routes, that's all.
Can't say for sure, doc. We all been keepin' our distance best we can, what with this virus goin' 'round. But as far as I know, he ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick.
