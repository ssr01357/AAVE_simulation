Well Doc, my little boy here been havin' trouble breathin' these past few days. He been wheezin' and coughin' a lot, especially after he be playin' out back. It's gettin' me real worried.
Nah, not in the past year. But when he was a baby, he had a lot of "wheezy bronchitis" and ear infections. They even put tubes in his ears when he was 'bout a year and a half old. He was in the hospital for a week when he was two 'cause of the same kinda symptoms he's havin' now. But that's about it.
He ain't on nothin' but a steroid cream we use for his skin condition - that atopic dermatitis. Ain't no other meds or supplements he takin'.
Well, he get watery eyes and start itchin' when he around pollen. That's the only allergy we know 'bout.
Nah, we ain't been nowhere recently. Just been stayin' around the house mostly.
Nah, doc. Ain't nobody in the house been sick and we ain't been around no sick folks neither. He just been playin' around the yard.
