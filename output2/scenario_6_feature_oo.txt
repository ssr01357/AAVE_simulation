Uh, I ain't feelin' too good, Doc. Got this sharp pain in my chest, right side. Can't hardly breathe. Pain's a solid 8 outta 10, hurts more when I breathe. Ain't never felt nothin' like this before.
Nah, Doc, I ain't had no procedures or nothin'. But I been dealin' with this emphysema and asthma for years now. But ain't nothin' like this ever happened before.
Nah, Doc, ain't takin' nothin' right now. Ain't got no prescriptions or nothin'. I been tryin' to handle my breathin' issues on my own. It's been tough, but I been managing.
Ain't got no allergies that I'm aware of, Doc. Ain't never had no reaction to nothin'.
Nah, Doc, ain't been nowhere. I just been steady workin' at the trucking company. Ain't had no time for no travelin'.
Nah, Doc, ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick. I been keepin' to myself mostly. Ain't nobody at the job been sick neither.
