Well doc, I'm havin' this real bad left-sided chest pain. It's sharp, like an 8 outta 10, started 'bout 45 minutes ago. Got me feelin' real anxious and all. Pain's movin' up to my jaw and to my back. Feel a bit short of breath, but it ain't gettin' worse when I breathe or move 'round. Ain't feelin' too good, kinda nauseous. But ain't got no fever, chills, cough, or blood in my spit. Got high blood pressure but been takin' my meds regularly. Ain't never had chest pain like this before.
Nah, ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year, doc. I been pretty healthy, 'cept for my high blood pressure, ya know.
Yes, doc. I been takin' Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure. But that's it, no other meds or supplements. I been stickin' to my meds, ain't missed none.
Ain't got no allergies, doc. Not to no food, no drugs, nothin'.
Nah, doc. Ain't been nowhere recently. Been stayin' home mostly, takin' my walks daily, and playin' bridge. That's 'bout it.
Nah, doc. I ain't been 'round nobody who's been sick. Been keepin' to myself, mostly.
