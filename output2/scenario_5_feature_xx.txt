I've been experiencing increasing pain and swelling in my knees over the past week. I'm also having trouble with fatigue and generalized weakness that have been going on for the past 4 months. The stiffness, especially after waking up, and aches in my joints have been really challenging. It even interferes with me taking care of my family. I've also noticed pain and swelling in my wrists and hands for about a month now. Acetaminophen only provides minimal relief.
