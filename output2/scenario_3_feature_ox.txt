My friend here, she been feelin' real sick. She been throwin' up, can't keep nothin' down, ain't been eatin' nothin'. She just been layin' down all day, feelin' all drowsy and out of it, you know? She got that diabetes, type 1, and ain't had her insulin cause she can't keep nothin' down.
Nah, not that I know of. Just her diabetes, that's all. She takes her insulin shots every day. But other than that, she ain't had no other problems, no surgeries or nothin'.
Nah, she ain't takin' nothin' else. Just her insulin for her diabetes, that's it. No over-the-counter stuff, no herbs or supplements. She don't even drink much, let alone use other stuff.
Shoot, I ain't sure, doc. She ain't never mentioned no allergies to me. But with her feelin' like this, I couldn't ask her none of that.
Nah, she ain't been nowhere recently. She been workin' a lot, ain't had no time for travelin'. Plus with all this sickness, she ain't been able to go nowhere.
Not that I'm aware of, doc. She ain't mentioned bein' 'round nobody who's sick. She mostly just been workin' and then came home and got sick herself.
