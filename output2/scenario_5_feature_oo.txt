Well, Doc, my knees been hurtin' and swellin' up this past week. It ain't easy, I tell ya. Takes a toll on me, especially when I gotta get my kids ready for school. This here pain been real bad, like a 5 outta 10, can't barely get no relief.
Nah, ain't had nothin' like that. Last time I been in a hospital was for childbirth, that was over a year ago though. Other than that, I ain't got no other medical problems. I'm just takin' my oral contraceptives, that's it.
Just the oral contraceptives, Doc. I been tryin' to ease the pain with some Acetaminophen, but it ain't doin' much good. Brings the pain down to a 4, but it's still there. Ain't been usin' no herbal stuff or nothin' else.
I ain't got no allergies, Doc. Never had any problems with that.
Nah, ain't been nowhere. Just been here, tryin' to run my business and take care of my family. Ain't got no time for travelin'.
Nah, Doc. Ain't nobody in my house been sick, and I ain't been around nobody else who been sick either.
