Mother: My son has been having increasing shortness of breath and wheezing over the past 3 days. He also has a cough that seems to be getting worse. I've noticed he coughs more after playing outside.
Mother: No, he hasn't had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. However, when he was 2, he was hospitalized for a week because of similar symptoms. He had to be given IV antibiotics and oxygen through a face mask.
Mother: The only medication he is on right now is a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. He's not taking any over-the-counter or herbal supplements.
Mother: He has an allergy to pollen. It causes his eyes to water and itch.
Mother: No, we haven't traveled anywhere recently. We've mostly been home.
Mother: Not that I'm aware of. We've been careful about his exposure, especially since his symptoms started.
