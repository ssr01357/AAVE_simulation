My roommate, she brought me in. I ain't been feelin' good, doc. Been throwin' up, ain't had no energy. Ain't ate nothin' yesterday and been feelin' real sleepy now. I got that diabetes, you know, the type 1 kind, and I ain't had no insulin in a day. Ain't been feelin' no pain, ain't had no diarrhea or no fever, but I did had some chills yesterday.
Nah, ain't had no procedures or no major sicknesses in the past year, doc. Just this diabetes that I got. I take insulin for it every day, but I ain't took none in the last 24 hours.
Nah, doc, I ain't takin' nothin' but my insulin. I ain't took no over-the-counter stuff or no herbs. It's just me and my insulin, and like I said, I ain't had none in a day.
Ain't got no allergies that I know of, doc. At least, ain't none ever come up before.
Nah, doc, ain't been nowhere recently. Just been stayin' around here.
Ain't been 'round nobody who's sick, doc. Been keepin' to myself mostly.
