Well, ain't it a thing. I had me a seizure and I was out cold. Woke up all confused and ain't been feeling right since.
No, no. Ain't had no hospital stays or procedures. Ain't been sick, neither. Just these prenatal vitamins is all I been on.
Ain't on no other medicines but them prenatal vitamins. Ain't been using no supplements or over-the-counter stuff, neither.
I ain't got no allergies. Not one. Ain't never had no problems with no medicines or foods or nothing like that.
Ain't been nowhere lately. Been home most of the time, what with the baby coming and all. Ain't had no trips, no traveling.
Ain't been around no sick people. Ain't nobody at work been ill neither. Ain't no one in the family been sick. Been keeping myself safe, you know.
