Well, my little boy here, he ain't been breathin' right these past few days. He be wheezin' and that cough of his, it's been gettin' worse. Seem like he cough more after he done play outside. This ain't the first time either, he been havin' these episodes after playin' in the backyard. Ain't no fever or nothin', but he just can't seem to catch his breath.
Naw, he ain't had no procedures or nothin' like that in the past year. But he been hospitalized when he was 2 for the same kinda symptoms. They had him on IV antibiotics and oxygen. But other than that, ain't nothin' major happened this past year. He just been havin' this shortness of breath and wheezin'. It's been happenin' more often, that's why we here.
Yeah, he be usin' a steroid cream for his skin, you know, cause of that atopic dermatitis. But other than that, he ain't takin' nothin' else. No over-the-counter stuff or herbal things. Just that cream for his skin.
My boy, he got a thing with pollen. It make his eyes all watery and itchy. But ain't no other allergies that we know of. Just that pollen. It just mess with him bad.
Naw, we ain't been nowhere recently. We just been stayin' home, ain't done no traveling or nothing.
Nah, he ain't been around nobody who's sick. We been keepin' him away from all that, we ain't want him catchin' nothin' else. He just been home, playin' in the backyard. That's it.
