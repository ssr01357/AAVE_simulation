Well, doc, it's this awful chest pain I been having. It's sharp and it's on my left side. Came on real sudden-like about 45 minutes ago. I'd say it's about an 8 on that 10-point scale y'all use. The pain, it's been radiating to my left jaw and my back. Got me feeling short of breath and a bit nauseous, but ain't no palpitations or light-headedness. Ain't worse when I breathe or move neither. Ain't had no fever, chills, cough, or blood in my spit. I been taking my high blood pressure meds like I should, haven't had no episodes of chest pain before.
Doctor: Have you had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
