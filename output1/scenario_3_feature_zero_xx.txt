Doctor: What brings you in today?
As her roommate, I had to bring her in because she's been very ill. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting for the past 24 hours and has now become very drowsy and lethargic. She's been so sick that she hasn't been able to eat or take her insulin. She's a type 1 diabetic and usually takes insulin several times a day, but she hasn't had any in the past 24 hours.
Doctor: Has she had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
As far as I know, she hasn't had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. She does have type 1 diabetes which she manages with insulin, but besides that, I'm not aware of any other health issues.
Doctor: Is she currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
She takes insulin multiple times a day for her diabetes. But because of her nausea and vomiting, she hasn't taken any for the past 24 hours. Other than that, she doesn't use any other medications or substances. I'm not aware of her taking any over-the-counter or herbal supplements either.
Doctor: What allergies does she have?
I'm sorry, but I'm not aware of any allergies she might have. She's been my roommate for a while, but she's never mentioned anything about having any allergies.
Doctor: Has she traveled anywhere recently?
I'm not aware of her traveling anywhere recently. She's been quite busy with work as an advertising sales representative and hasn't had much time for travel.
Doctor: Has she been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently?
Not that I know of. She hasn't mentioned being around anyone who's been sick recently.
