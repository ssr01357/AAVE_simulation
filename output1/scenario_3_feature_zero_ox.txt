Well, doc, my roommate brought me here 'cause I been feelin' real sick. I been throwin' up and feelin' nauseous for about a day now. I ain't had no food or nothin' 'cause of it. And I ain't even have my insulin for my diabetes. Now I'm feelin' real tired and kinda out of it. Can't seem to shake this off.
Doctor: Have you had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
Nah, doc. Ain't nothing like that. Only thing I got is my diabetes. I take my insulin for it usually, but I ain't had none in the last 24 hours. Just been too sick to remember, y'know?
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
Nah, doc, only thing I take is my insulin for my diabetes. I ain't been able to take it recently though, been feelin' too sick. I don't use no other medications or substances.
Doctor: What allergies do you have?
Ain't got any allergies, doc, least not that I know of. Never had no sort of reaction to nothin'.

Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. Just been at home mostly, workin' and such. Ain't had no time for no travels.
Doctor: Have you been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently?
Ain't been 'round nobody sick that I know of, doc. Just been me and my roommate, and she fine. I ain't been out much neither, so I can't recall being 'round nobody who was ill.
