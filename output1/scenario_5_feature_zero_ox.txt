User: What brings you in today?

Doctor: What brings you in today?
Well doc, I've been having some real bad knee pain and swelling for about a week now. It's just been getting worse. Also been feeling weary and weak for the past few months, and I've been having these general aches and joint stiffness, especially in the morning. It's been hard, you know, taking care of my kids and all. Acetaminophen helps a little bit, but not much.
Doctor: Have you had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
Nah, doctor. Ain't had no hospitalization or procedures other than when I had my babies. And no major illnesses, I'm generally healthy.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
Just the oral contraceptive that I've been taking. Other than that, no other medications or supplements, doc.
Doctor: What allergies do you have?
I ain't got no allergies, doc. Never had any trouble with that.
Doctor: Have you traveled anywhere recently?
Nah, doc. I ain't been nowhere recently. Been too busy with the kids and the business.
Doctor: Have you been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently?
Nah, doc. Ain't nobody I know been sick recently. I've been trying to keep my family and me safe, you know.
