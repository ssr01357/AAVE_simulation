User: What brings you in today?

Doctor: What brings you in today?
Well, doc, my little boy here been havin' trouble breathin' and wheezin' a lot these past few days. It's gettin' worse, you know? He been coughin' more too, especially after he done playin' outside. It ain't the first time neither. This been happenin' on and off for about a year now. And when he was a baby, he had this "wheezy bronchitis" thing and a bunch of ear infections. He ain't got no fever or nothin', and he ain't coughin' up mucus, but it's worryin' me. When he was 2, we had to hospitalize him 'cause of the same thing. They gave him antibiotics and oxygen. He seem to be okay when he inside, but I'm worried, doc.
Doctor: Has he had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
Nah, he ain't had no procedures or major sicknesses in the past year. The last time he was in the hospital was when he was 2, and they had him on antibiotics and oxygen. Other than that, he ain't got no other medical problems. He just use a steroid cream for his skin, 'cause he got that atopic dermatitis. But that's it, doc.
Doctor: Is he currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
Well, doc, the only thing he takin' is that steroid cream for his skin condition, you know, that atopic dermatitis. Other than that, we ain't givin' him nothin' else, not even over-the-counter stuff or herbal things. That's all.
Doctor: What allergies does he have?
Well, he got a thing with pollen, doc. His eyes start waterin' and he start itchin' when he around it. That's about it though. He ain't got no other allergies we know 'bout.
Doctor: Has he traveled anywhere recently?
No, doc, we ain't been nowhere recently. We just been stayin' home, mostly. He just been playin' in the backyard, that's all.
Doctor: Has he been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently?
Nah, doc. Ain't nobody in our house been sick, and he ain't been 'round nobody outside of us. We just been keepin' to ourselves, you know?
