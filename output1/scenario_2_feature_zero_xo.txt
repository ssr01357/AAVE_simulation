Doctor: What brings you in today?
Well, Doc, my little boy, he been havin' trouble breathin' and such. He been wheezin' too, and coughin' a lot, especially after he done play outside. It's been going on for a few days now, and it ain't gettin' no better. It's like he can't catch his breath sometimes, and it's scaring me. He used to have them "wheezy bronchitis" episodes when he was an infant and a similar thing happened when he was two. They had to put him on oxygen and all. He ain't got no fever or nothin' though, and he ain't coughing up no mucus.
Doctor: Has he had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
Ain't no procedures or major sickness been troubling him in the past 12 months. Only thing he got is this atopic dermatitis, and we been using a steroid cream for that. But other than this breathin' trouble now, he been mostly okay. He was in the hospital when he was two for this same breathin' trouble. They had to give him IV antibiotics and oxygen by face mask. But that's a while ago. Other than that, he ain't been sick or nothin'.
Doctor: Is he currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
Only thing he be taking is that steroid cream for his skin condition, his atopic dermatitis. Ain't no other medicines or supplements he be taking.
Doctor: What allergies does he have?
My boy, he can't be around pollen. It causes his eyes to water and itch something fierce. Ain't no other allergies I know of.
Doctor: Has he traveled anywhere recently?
No, sir, we ain't been nowhere recently. He just been staying home, playing in the backyard mostly. We ain't done no traveling.
Doctor: Has he been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently?
No, ain't nobody around us been sick lately. We been careful, especially with all that's going around. So, no, he ain't been around no sick folks.
