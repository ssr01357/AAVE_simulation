User: What brings you in today?

Doctor: What brings you in today?
He can't answer right now, doc. But he was workin', and then outta nowhere, he started gettin' this real bad pain in the right side of his chest. He was strugglin' to breathe too. We ain't never seen nothin' like this happen to him before. He's got emphysema and asthma though, had 'em for years. They gave him some oxygen on the way here.
Doctor: Has he had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
Nah, doctor, he ain't had no procedures or major sicknesses in the past year. Just his usual emphysema and asthma, you know, but nothin' more than that.
Doctor: Is he currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
I ain't too sure 'bout all of 'em, doc. But I know he takes somethin' for his emphysema and asthma. And he been takin' some over-the-counter stuff for a cough he been havin'. As for them herbal supplements, I can't say he be into any of that.
Doctor: What allergies does he have?
Doc, as far as I know, he ain't got no allergies. Never heard him mention any.
Doctor: Has he traveled anywhere recently?
Nah, doc, he ain't been travelin'. He's been stickin' around here, workin' at the truckin' company.
Doctor: Has he been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently?
Can't say he has, doc. We all been keepin' our distance, you know, with this pandemic and all. Don't think he's been round anyone sick.
