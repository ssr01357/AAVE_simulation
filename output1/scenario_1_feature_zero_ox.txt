Got me feeling short of breath and a bit queasy. Ain't no change when I move or breathe different though. Ain't never had this before.
Doctor: Have you had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months?
Nah, doc, nothing like that. Ain't been sick or had no procedures done in the past year. Just been dealing with my high blood pressure for the past 5 years, but I take my meds regularly.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements?
Yes, doc, I'm taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure. But other than that, I ain't taking no over-the-counter stuff or herbal supplements, no sir.
