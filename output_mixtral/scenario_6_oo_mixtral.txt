Well, doc, it's my husband here. He was workin' and suddenly started havin' this real sharp pain on his chest, right side, and had some real trouble breathin'. Never seen him like this before, but he's had emphysema and asthma for years. We called the ambulance, and they gave him oxygen on the way here. He's in a bad way, can't hardly talk right now.

No, sir, he ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year, as far as I know. Like I said, he's been livin' with emphysema and asthma for years, but nothing out of the ordinary recently. We try to keep up with his medications and treatments, but this here just came out of nowhere.
||
Yes, he's on some medications, mainly for his emphysema and asthma. He takes a couple of inhalers, one's a bronchodilator, and the other's a corticosteroid, plus some other pills for his breathing. I can't recall their names right off hand, but I got a list of his medications at home. He doesn't take no over-the-counter stuff or herbal supplements, just what the doctors prescribe.
||
He doesn't have no allergies to medicines, that I know of. He's never had any bad reactions to his medications or treatments for his emphysema and asthma. We've been pretty careful about that, makin' sure he's only takin' what's been prescribed for him.
||
No, sir, we haven't traveled nowhere recently. With his condition, we've been tryin' to keep things low-key and avoid any unnecessary risks. We've mostly stayed around home, just goin' about our daily lives, visitin' family and friends, and goin' to the doctor when we need to. So, no, we ain't been on no trips or vacations lately.
||
Not that I know of, doc. We've been careful about who we've been around, tryin' to avoid anyone who's been sick. With his emphysema and asthma, he's more susceptible to gettin' infections and such, so we've been extra cautious. We ain't been to no crowded places or nothin' like that. I can't think of anyone we've been in contact with who's been sick.
