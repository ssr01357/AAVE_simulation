Well, my son, he's been havin' trouble breathin' and a real bad cough for the past few days. It's been gettin' worse, and he even wheezes some. He seems to cough more after playin' outside. I've noticed this happenin' a few times over the past year, especially after playin' in the backyard, but it usually goes away shortly after comin' inside.

No, he ain't had no major procedures or illnesses in the past year, doc. But I do remember when he was about 2, he was hospitalized for a week 'cause of similar symptoms. They gave him IV antibiotics and oxygen through a mask back then. He did have them little tubes put in his ears when he was 18 months old, though.

Yes, he takes a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis, that's all. Ain't on nothin' else, not even over-the-counter stuff or herbal supplements.
||
He's allergic to pollen, doc. It gives him real watery eyes and makes 'im itch. That's all we know of so far. We ain't really exposed him to too many things yet, see, he's still real young.
||
No, sir, we ain't traveled nowhere recently. We been right here in town, just goin' about our daily routine. Ain't been on no trips or nothin'.
||
Not that I know of, doc. We ain't had no visitors recently, and he ain't been around no sick folks at daycare or nothin'. I try to keep 'im away from anybody who's feelin' under the weather.
