Hello, thank you for seeing me. I've been experiencing increasing pain and swelling in my knees for the past week. It's been difficult to take care of my family because of the discomfort, and even acetaminophen doesn't seem to provide much relief. I've also noticed generalized aches, joint stiffness, and fatigue for the past 4 months, which has made my daily activities more challenging.

No, I haven't had any hospitalizations or major illnesses in the past 12 months. My only medical issue was giving birth to my third child 11 months ago, but it was a normal delivery without any complications. I've been in good health overall, and my only medication has been an oral contraceptive.
||
Yes, I take an oral contraceptive, and I don't use any other medications, over-the-counter products, or herbal supplements. I've been taking the oral contraceptive for several years without any issues, and I don't have any allergies to medications.
||
I don't have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors. I've never had any reactions to any medications, including my oral contraceptive, and I've never experienced symptoms like rashes, hives, or difficulty breathing after exposure to any substances.
||
No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. I've been staying at home and focusing on taking care of my family. I haven't had any known infectious exposures, and I haven't been in contact with anyone who has been sick. I've been trying to stay healthy and avoid any potential illnesses.
||
No, I haven't been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently. I've been careful about avoiding contact with people who are ill, and I've been practicing good hygiene to prevent the spread of germs. I haven't noticed any symptoms of infection, such as fever, chills, or night sweats. I've been feeling generally weak and fatigued, but I don't think it's related to any infectious diseases.
