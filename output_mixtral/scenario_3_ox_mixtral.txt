Hello, doc. My roommate brung me in today 'cause I've been feelin' real sick. I been havin' nausea and vomitin' for the past day, and now I'm feelin' real weak and sleepy. I ain't eaten nothin' since yesterday 'cause of it. I got type 1 diabetes, and I usually take my insulin shots regularly, but I ain't had any in the past 24 hours. My roommate said I had some chills yesterday, but I ain't got no fever or belly pain, and I don't drink much neither. I only smoke cigarettes and don't use no other substances.

No, sir, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. I been pretty healthy, 'cept for my diabetes. I try to take good care of myself, but I admit I ain't always as consistent as I should be with my insulin and diet.

Yeah, doc, I take insulin shots for my diabetes. I usually take 'em multiple times a day, but I ain't had any in the past day or so 'cause of bein' sick. I don't take no other prescription meds, and I don't really use over-the-counter stuff either, 'cept for the occasional pain reliever if I got a headache or somethin'. I don't use herbal supplements neither. I try to keep it simple with my health, you know? Just stick to what my doctor tells me.
||
As far as I know, doc, I ain't got no allergies to medications or nothin'. I never had no bad reactions to any medicines or nothin' like that. So I reckon I'm good on that front.
||
No, sir, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I been stayin' at home, workin' and takin' care of myself. I ain't been on no trips or nothin', so I don't think that's related to how I'm feelin'.
||
Not that I know of, doc. I mean, I been around people at work and such, but nobody's mentioned bein' sick or anything. My roommate ain't been sick neither. So I don't think I've been around nobody with any contagious diseases or nothin'. I been takin' care to wash my hands and all that, tryin' to stay healthy.
