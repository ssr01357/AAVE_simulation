Me? I've been feelin' real sick the past day. Had me some nasty nausea and vomiting, and now I'm all weak and drowsy. I haven't had any insulin in 24 hours 'cause of it. My type 1 diabetes mellitus, you see. My roommate said I got real pale and curled up in a ball, so she brought me here. Ain't had no appetite, no abdominal pain, diarrhea, or fever, but I did have some chills yesterday.

My past's unclear, only know I got diabetes, take insulin shots regular. Don't know much 'bout my family history, and I'm divorced, no kids. Been smoking 'bout half a pack a day for three years, but I rarely drink. Work in advertising sales, and I don't got no special recreational habits.

I'm feelin' real bad, doc. Can you help me?

No, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year, not that I know of. My roommate ain't mentioned nothin' either. My main issue's been my diabetes, but I usually manage it well. Just this one time I forgot to take my insulin, and things went south.

Yes, I be takin' insulin for my diabetes. I got a prescription for it, multiple times a day. I don't take no other medications, not regularly. Sometimes I might take an over-the-counter pill for headaches, but not often. Never used no herbal supplements neither. I try to keep things simple, you know? Just me and my insulin.

Allergies, huh? I don't got no known allergies, doc. Never had a reaction to any medications, foods, or nothin'. I've been lucky that way, I guess. Knock on wood.
||
No, I haven't traveled nowhere recently. Been here in town, workin' and takin' care of myself. I ain't been on no trips or nothin' like that. My world's been pretty small lately, just work and home.

I don't think so, doc. I mean, I ain't know of anyone around me bein' sick. I keep to myself mostly, and when I'm out and about, I don't really talk to many people. My roommate's been healthy as far as I know, and she's the one I spend the most time with. If she'd been exposed to someone sick, I reckon she would've told me, but I can't be too sure, I s'pose.
