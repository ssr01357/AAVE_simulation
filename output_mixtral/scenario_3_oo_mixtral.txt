Well, I've been feelin' real sick for the past day. I had some real bad nausea and vomited quite a few times. Just a bit ago, I got real drowsy and lethargic, so my roommate brought me in. I ain't eaten nothin' since yesterday cause of the sickness. I do have diabetes and I haven't had any insulin in the past 24 hours. I don't got no abdominal pain, diarrhea, or fever, but I did say I had some chills yesterday. I rarely drinks, and I don't use no other substances.

Naw, I can't recall no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. I mean, I usually takes my insulin shots for my diabetes, but that's about it. I don't know about the past 12 months of my history, my roommate ain't aware of nothin' else.

Yeah, I takes insulin shots for my diabetes. It's usually multiple times a day. I don't take no other medications, not even over-the-counter or herbal supplements. I don't got no allergies either, as far as I know.
||
I ain't got no allergies, doc. I can't recall havin' any allergic reactions to medications or food in the past. My roommate ain't aware of any allergies I got, neither.
||
No, I haven't traveled nowhere recently. Been stayin' at home, goin' to work, and that's about it. Ain't been nowhere outta the ordinary. I don't think I caught any sickness from travelin', cause I ain't been nowhere.

Not that I can think of, doc. I mean, I works in advertisin' sales, so I meets a lotta people, but nobody that I know of has been sick recently. My roommate ain't mentioned bein' around sick people, neither. I don't think that's where I got sick from.
