I am a 25-year-old woman, 38 weeks pregnant, and I experienced a seizure today. My husband found me having a seizure about 10 minutes before we came to the emergency department. I have had a severe headache for the past three days, and my feet have been swollen for the past two to three weeks. I have never had a seizure before and have no history of renal or neurologic disease. I have been receiving routine prenatal care and had an uncomplicated pregnancy until now. I am conscious but feel quite confused.

No, I have not been hospitalized, and I haven't had any major illnesses in the past 12 months. I have been in good health, except for the recent headaches and swollen feet. I am currently taking prenatal vitamins, and I don't have any known allergies or take any other medications. I am up to date on my vaccinations.
||
I am only taking prenatal vitamins, which I started after confirming my pregnancy. I don't take any other prescribed medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet and exercise, so I don't usually take any supplements or medications unless necessary.
||
I don't have any known allergies. I have never experienced any allergic reactions to medications, food, or environmental factors such as pollen or pet dander. I am not aware of any allergies in my family history either.
||
No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. Due to my pregnancy, I have been cautious about traveling long distances or visiting places with potential health risks. My last trip was a few months ago when we went to visit my mother, who lives in the same city. My pregnancy has been fairly routine, and I haven't had any complications that would prevent me from going about my daily activities, but I have tried to minimize any unnecessary risks or stress.

I don't believe I have been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently. My husband and I have been careful about maintaining good hygiene and avoiding close contact with people who show signs of illness. Since the onset of my pregnancy, I have been diligent about practicing good hand hygiene, wearing a mask when in crowded places, and avoiding people who appear to be sick. However, I do work as a nursing assistant, so I am around patients and coworkers regularly. I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work recently, but it is possible that I may have been exposed unknowingly.
