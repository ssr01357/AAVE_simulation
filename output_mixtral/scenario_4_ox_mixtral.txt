Well, I'm here because my husband found me having a seizure earlier. I ain't never had one before, and I don't know what's goin' on. I've had a bad headache for the past few days, and my feets have been swollen for a couple of weeks. I've been pregnant, and my due date is soon, but I've been doing good otherwise. I haven't had any problems with my pregnancy, and I've been going to all my appointments.

No, I can't recall nothin' like that. I've been pretty healthy, except for bein' pregnant. I've just been taking my prenatal vitamins and tryin' to take care of myself. I've been workin' as a nursing assistant, and I've been able to keep up with my job just fine. I ain't had no surgeries or hospital stays or anythin' like that.

Just my prenatal vitamins, that's all I take. I don't take no other medications, not even over-the-counter ones or herbal supplements. I try to keep it natural and simple, you know? I don't like puttin' too many things in my body if I don't have to. I've been feelin' good during my pregnancy, so I didn't see no need to take any extra stuff.
||
I don't have no allergies that I know of. I've never had any reactions to medications, food, or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky in that way, I guess. If I ever notice anythin' strange happenin' after I eat or take somethin', I make sure to tell my doctor about it. But so far, I've been good, and I don't have any allergies that I know of.

No, I haven't traveled recently. I've been stayin' close to home, just workin' and gettin' ready for the baby. I ain't been on no trips or nothin' like that. I like to travel, but I've been too busy with other things lately. I've been savin' up my energy for when the baby comes, so I can take care of her and show her the world. But for now, I'm just stayin' put and takin' it easy.

Not that I know of. I've been workin' as a nursing assistant, so I'm around sick people all the time, but I always make sure to wear my protective gear and wash my hands. I've been real careful about that, especially since I'm pregnant. I don't want to take any chances with my baby's health. I ain't been around anyone who's been really sick, though, like with a fever or anything like that. I've been feelin' pretty good myself, just that headache and the swollen feet. But I don't think that's anything serious.
