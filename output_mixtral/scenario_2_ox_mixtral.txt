Hello, doctor. My son here has been having some trouble breathing over the past few days, and it's been getting worse. He's been wheezing and coughing quite a bit too, especially after playing outside. I've noticed this happening before, but it seems to be worse this time. He was hospitalized when he was two because of similar symptoms, and they gave him antibiotics and oxygen.

No, doctor, he's been relatively healthy in the past year. He did get those pressure equalization tubes inserted when he was 18 months old, but nothing else since then. He has been using a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis, but that's it. He was up to date on all his vaccinations too.

Yes, doctor, he's currently taking a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. That's the only medication he's on, and we don't give him any over-the-counter or herbal supplements. We try to keep things simple for him.

He's allergic to pollen, doctor. It usually gives him watery eyes and makes him itchy. We've noticed that his allergies seem to bother him more when we're outside playing, but we haven't connected it to his breathing problems yet.

No, doctor, we haven't traveled anywhere recently. We've been staying close to home because of his breathing issues. We don't want to take any unnecessary risks that might make things worse for him. We've mostly been going to the park and playing in our backyard.

No, doctor, we can't think of anyone he's been exposed to who's been sick recently. We've been keeping a close eye on him and his sister, and neither of them have shown any signs of illness. We've been trying to keep them away from anyone who might be sick, especially since his breathing problems started.
