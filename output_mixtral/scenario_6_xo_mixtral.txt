Me? I'm havin' real bad chest pain on my right side, and I's been havin' trouble breathin'. It's like a sharp knife stickin' in me, and it hurts something awful. Can't hardly talk from the pain. My coworker, they called the ambulance and brought me here. I ain't never had this happen before, but I got emphysema and asthma for years. They give me oxygen on the way here. Don't know 'bout nothin' else, doc.

No, sir, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. I tries to stay healthy, but I do got them lung problems. I's been manage it with my inhaler and treatments, but this here pain, it's somethin' else. Ain't nothin' like this I ever felt before.
||
Yes, I does take medications. I's got my inhaler for the asthma, and I takes some pills for the emphysema. Can't remember the names right off, doc, but they's in my medical records. I don't take no other medications, over-the-counter or herbal supplements. I tries to keep it simple and do what the doctors tell me. Ain't no sense in messin' around with that stuff when I got these here conditions to manage.
||
I's got allergies to penicillin and them sulfa drugs. They make me break out in hives and have trouble breathin'. I remember that real good 'cause it ain't fun. Otherwise, I don't got no other allergies that I knows of. I's be real careful 'bout tryin' new things 'cause I don't want no bad reactions. I's learned that the hard way, doc.
||
No, sir, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I's been workin' and goin' to my appointments, but that's about it. Ain't got the time or money for travelin', and I's pretty happy stayin' here in my town. Ain't nothin' wrong with it, and I knows people everywhere. I's just a simple man, doc, and I likes it that way. Ain't got no need for fancy trips or nothin'.
||
Not that I knows of, doc. I's been around my coworkers and family, but ain't nobody been real sick that I knows of. We all tries to stay healthy and take care of ourselves, but you know how it goes. People get colds and such, but ain't nobody been real sick. I's been keepin' my distance from people when I can, just in case, but ain't nobody stood out as bein' sick.
