Well, doc, I've been experiencing some real bad chest pain on the left side. It came on all of a sudden 'bout 45 minutes ago, and I'd rate it as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. This pain is sharp, and it's been radiating to my jaw and back. I'm a bit short of breath, but my breathing ain't making it worse, and my position doesn't seem to affect it either. I'm feeling a bit queasy, but I got no palpitations or lightheadedness. I haven't had any fever, chills, cough, or spit up any blood. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure 5 years back, and I've been taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide since then. I've been real good about taking my meds, and I haven't had no chest pain before, not even during exertion.

No, sir, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. My last hospitalization was for my cesarean deliveries when I was 32 and 27. Apart from that, I've been in good health, just managing my high blood pressure. My sister and brother are the ones with medical issues; my brother has hypertension like me, and my sister is doing just fine. My spouse passed away 7 years ago, and I have two grown children. I don't smoke, but I do enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner, and I've always kept up to date with my vaccinations. I retired from being an insurance underwriter, and I've got a high school diploma. In my free time, I play tournament bridge and take walks for about 2 to 3 miles each day.

Yes, I'm currently taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure, and that's it. I don't take any other medications, not even over-the-counter ones or herbal supplements. I've always been careful about what I put in my body, especially since my hypertension diagnosis. I don't want anything to interfere with my prescribed meds or my health in general.

I don't have any allergies, doc. I've never had any reactions to medications, foods, or environmental factors that I know of. I've been fortunate in that regard, I suppose.
||
No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. The last time I went on a trip was a couple of years ago when I visited my daughter who lives out of state. I don't have any plans to travel soon, either, given my current health situation with this chest pain. I want to make sure I'm in good shape before I consider going anywhere.

Not that I can think of, doctor. I've been keeping to myself lately, just going about my daily routine. I walk in my neighborhood and play bridge with my friends, but nobody's mentioned being sick or having any symptoms. I've been cautious about being around people, especially since the pandemic started. I wear a mask and practice social distancing when I'm out and about. I haven't had any close contact with anyone who's been ill, as far as I know.
