Hello, thank you for seeing us. My 4-year-old son has been having increasing shortness of breath and wheezing for the past three days. It seems like his cough is getting worse too, especially after playing outside. I've noticed that he has had similar symptoms in the past, and he was hospitalized when he was two years old because of it. They gave him IV antibiotics and oxygen back then. He has a history of ''wheezy bronchitis'' and numerous ear infections as an infant. I just want to make sure he's alright.

No, he hasn't had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. His only current medication is a steroid cream for atopic dermatitis, and he is up to date with all his vaccinations. I'd like to add that he has pressure equalization tubes inserted when he was 18 months old. Other than that, he has been generally healthy, achieving all his age-appropriate milestones.

Yes, he is currently using a steroid cream for atopic dermatitis, but that's the only medication he is on. We do not give him any over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements regularly. Occasionally, if he has a fever, we might administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but that's not related to his current symptoms.
||
He has an allergy to pollen, which causes watery eyes and itching. Other than that, he doesn't have any known allergies to medications, foods, or other substances.
||
No, he hasn't traveled anywhere recently. We have been staying at home, and his symptoms started a few days ago. We haven't taken any trips or gone to any crowded places that might have exposed him to any unusual viruses or allergens.
||
Not that I know of. We have been careful about limiting his exposure to people who are sick. However, I do recall that a few of the children in his preschool had colds recently, so it's possible that he may have been exposed to something there. But to my knowledge, none of them had anything like what he's experiencing now.
