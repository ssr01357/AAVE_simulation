The patient (or caregiver speaking on behalf of the patient): I came in today because of a sudden, sharp chest pain that started about 45 minutes ago. The pain is on the left side and it's quite severe, I would rate it an 8 out of 10. It also radiates to my left jaw and back. I'm having some difficulty breathing, but the pain doesn't worsen with respiration or change in position. I'm feeling a bit nauseous, but I have no palpitations or lightheadedness. I haven't had a fever, chills, cough, or hemoptysis. I was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago and have been taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide since then. I have been adherent to my medication regimen and this is the first time I'm experiencing such chest pain.
||
The patient (or caregiver speaking on behalf of the patient): No, I haven't had any major procedures or illnesses in the past 12 months. My health has been quite good, except for my hypertension which has been well controlled with medication.
||
The patient (or caregiver speaking on behalf of the patient): Yes, I'm currently taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide as prescribed for my hypertension. I'm not taking any other medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements. I'm careful about not taking any medications without consulting my doctor, especially since my hypertension diagnosis.
||
The patient (or caregiver speaking on behalf of the patient): I don't have any known allergies. I've never had any allergic reactions to any medications, food, or environmental factors.
||
The patient (or caregiver speaking on behalf of the patient): No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. I generally don't travel much due to my health concerns, and the last time I traveled was a few months ago when I visited my children who live in the next town. I haven't been out of the state or country in several years.
||
The patient (or caregiver speaking on behalf of the patient): No, I haven't been exposed to anyone who's been sick recently. I live alone since my husband passed away 7 years ago, and my children visit me regularly but they are healthy. I don't have any visitors other than my family and close friends, and I haven't heard of anyone being sick among them. I'm quite careful about maintaining my health and avoiding exposure to illnesses.
