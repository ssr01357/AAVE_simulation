Doctor, I'm here cause of this real bad chest pain I been havin' on my left side. It came on sudden-like 'bout 45 minutes ago, and it's sharp, like a stabbin' feeling. Hurts somethin' awful, I tell ya. It's also goin' to my jaw and back, but breathin' or movin' don't make it no worse. I's feelin' a bit short of breath, and I got a slight feelin' of nausea, but no palpitations or light-headedness. Ain't had no fever or cough, and I ain't spittin' up no blood.

I's been diagnosed with hypertension 'bout 5 years back, and I's been takin' my lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide regular. Ain't missed a dose, and I ain't never had no chest pain 'fore, neither at rest nor when exertin' myself. Only other time I was in the hospital was when I had my two cesarean sections, and I ain't got no other medical issues.

My daddy passed from a stroke when he was 70, and my momma lived to be 92 before she went from natural causes. I got a 72-year-old brother with high blood pressure, and my two sisters, 69 and 55, are both healthy.

I's been a widow for goin' on 7 years now, and my two children are grown. Ain't been sexually active since my spouse passed, and I ain't never had no sexually transmitted infections. I's a retired insurance underwriter, and I's a high school graduate. I play tournament bridge and take a daily walk of 2 to 3 miles.

Can't recall any issues with my skin, and my HEENT is clear. Musculoskeletal is fine, and my cardiorespiratory system is as it should be, 'cept for this chest pain. Gastrointestinal-wise, it's the same as the HPI. My genitourinary system is normal, and I reached menopause at 50. No abnormal cervical cytology. Neuropsychiatric is clear.

So, doc, what could this here chest pain be?
||
No, sir, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past twelve months. I's been in good health, 'cept for this here hypertension. Been keepin' up with my regular check-ups, too. Ain't nothin' else standin' out, as far as I can recall.
||
Yes, I's been takin' my lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my hypertension. I ain't takin' no other prescribed medications, and I don't use no over-the-counter drugs regular. I do take an occasional ibuprofen for minor aches and pains, but that's 'bout it. I takes a daily multivitamin, and I sometimes drink ginseng tea for a energy boost, but that's all, doc. Ain't nothin' else I can think of.
||
I don't got no allergies to speak of, doc. Ain't never had no reactions to medications, food, or nothin' like that. Ain't nothin' in my past medical history that would suggest I'm allergic to anythin'. I's always been pretty healthy that way, I reckon.
||
No, sir, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I ain't left the city in months, 'cept for my regular walks and bridge tournaments. I ain't been on no planes or nothin', and I ain't visited no other countries or states. I's been stayin' put right here, so I don't think my chest pain's related to travelin'.
||
No, I can't say I've been exposed to nobody sick lately. I's been keepin' to myself, and I ain't been in close contact with no one who's been ill. I's been careful 'bout washin' my hands and keepin' my distance when I'm out and 'bout. Ain't had no visitors 'cept for my family, and they's all healthy, far as I know. So, no, I don't think I've been exposed to no sickness that would cause this chest pain.
