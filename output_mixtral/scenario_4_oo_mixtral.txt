Well, I'm here 'cause I had a seizure earlier today. My husband found me and brought me in. I ain't never had a seizure before, and I've been feeling real confused since it happened. I've had a bad headache for the past few days, and my feet have been swollen for a couple of weeks. I've been healthy otherwise, and this pregnancy's been going smooth 'til now.

No, ma'am, I haven't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. I've been in good health, just dealing with this pregnancy and working as a nursing assistant. I don't take no medications, ain't got no allergies, and my vaccinations are up to date. My husband and I are active, but only with each other, and I don't smoke or drink. I read, watch movies, and go horseback riding for fun.

No, ma'am, I ain't taking no medications right now. I just been taking my prenatal vitamins, that's it. I don't take nothing over-the-counter or no herbal supplements. I believe in keeping things natural, you know? I don't got no allergies, so I don't need to worry 'bout reactions to meds.

I don't got no allergies, ma'am. Ain't never had a problem with medications, food, or environmental stuff. I'm real lucky that way, I guess. I can eat most things and take whatever meds the doc prescribes without worry. I know some folks ain't so lucky, so I count my blessings.

No, ma'am, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I been staying here in town, working and getting ready for the baby. My husband and I, we like to travel, but with the pregnancy and all, we decided to stay put. We went on a babymoon a couple of months back, but that's it. We visited a nice bed and breakfast upstate, real peaceful and quiet. Since then, I ain't been nowhere else.
||
Not that I know of, ma'am. I been keeping to myself mostly, just work and home. I ain't been around nobody that's been sick or had any symptoms. My coworkers have been healthy, and my family too. My mom had endometrial cancer a couple of years back, but she's been cancer-free since then. I ain't had no contact with sick people, so I don't think that's what caused my seizure.
