Husband brought me 'cause I had a seizure and passed out. Haven't never had one before. Had a bad headache for three days, and feet been swollen 'bout two, three weeks.
||
No, ma'am. Ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. Been real healthy, 'sides the headache and swelling. Ain't been to the hospital or nothing. Ain't on no medications 'cept prenatal vitamins. Ain't got no allergies neither. Up to date on vaccinations.
||
Just the prenatal vitamins, that's all. Ain't got no other medications, not even over-the-counter or herbal stuff. Ain't got no allergies, so ain't got to worry 'bout reactions and such. Ain't been sick, just that headache and swelling.
||
Ain't got no allergies, ma'am. Ain't never had no reactions to medications, food, or nothin'. Ain't had to worry 'bout that, 'sides the regular environmental allergies like pollen and dust, but ain't nothin' serious. Ain't got no allergies that I know of. Ain't got no allergies to report. Ain't got no allergies, so that's good. Ain't got no issues with medications or nothin'. Ain't allergic to nothin'. Ain't got no allergies, so ain't no worries there.
||
No, ma'am. Ain't traveled nowhere recently. Ain't been on no trips or vacations in a good while. Ain't been nowhere outside the usual places I go. Ain't had the chance or the reason to travel. Ain't been nowhere foreign or exotic. Ain't been on no planes or trains. Ain't been nowhere but home, work, and the grocery store. Ain't been nowhere special. Ain't been nowhere out of the ordinary. Ain't been nowhere new.
||
Not that I can think of, ma'am. Ain't been around nobody that I know of who's been sick recently. Ain't had no contact with sick people at work or nowhere else. Ain't been near no one with a cold or the flu or nothin'. Ain't been exposed to no contagious diseases or viruses. Ain't been around no one who's had any kind of infection. Ain't been near no sickness or illness. Ain't been close to no contagion. Ain't been in contact with no sickness. Ain't been exposed to no germs or bugs. Ain't been around no sick people.
