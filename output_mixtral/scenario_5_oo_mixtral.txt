Well, doc, it's my knees that been botherin' me. They been swollen and painful for 'bout a week now, and nothin' I done seems to help. I'm havin' a hard time takin' care of my family, and it's been tough on me.

No, sir, I ain't had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. I been fairly healthy, 'cept for the usual colds and such. My last hospitalization was for childbirth, 'bout three years ago.
||
Yes, I'm currently takin' oral contraceptives, and I do take acetaminophen from time to time for the pain, but it don't help much. I don't take no other medications or supplements, though. I tries to keep it natural, you know?
||
I don't got no allergies, doc. Never had no problems with that, as far as I know.
||
No, sir, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I don't get out much, what with takin' care of my family and runnin' my small business. I mostly stay in the neighborhood, goin' to church and doin' my daily routine.

No, I can't say I have. I mean, people catch colds and such, but I don't think I been around anyone who's been real sick. I'm pretty careful 'bout washin' my hands and keepin' my distance when folks ain't feelin' well.
