I'm here because I've been experiencing nausea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. My roommate brought me in because I became drowsy and lethargic in the past hour. I haven't eaten anything yesterday due to the nausea and vomiting. I have type 1 diabetes mellitus and usually take insulin multiple times a day, but I haven't had any insulin in the past 24 hours. I don't remember having any abdominal pain, diarrhea, or fever, although I did have some chills yesterday. I rarely drink alcohol and don't use any other medications or substances.

To the best of my knowledge, I haven't had any major procedures or illnesses in the past 12 months. However, I have been managing my type 1 diabetes mellitus as usual, taking insulin multiple times a day. But, as I mentioned earlier, I haven't had any insulin in the past 24 hours due to my current condition.

Yes, I am currently taking insulin multiple times a day to manage my type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, I haven't taken any insulin in the past 24 hours due to my nausea and vomiting. Apart from insulin, I don't take any other prescribed medications, over-the-counter medicines, or herbal supplements. I do smoke about half a pack of cigarettes a day and occasionally drink alcohol, but I haven't had any alcohol in the past few days due to feeling unwell.

I have a known allergy to penicillin. Whenever I have taken penicillin in the past, I've experienced hives and difficulty breathing. I carry an EpiPen with me for emergencies. However, I don't have any known allergies to insulin or any other medications I take for my diabetes management.

No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. I work as an advertising sales representative, and my job primarily keeps me in the local area. I've been living and working in the same place for the past few years, and I haven't taken any trips recently. So, I don't think my current condition is related to any recent travel.

Not that I'm aware of. I live with a roommate, but they have not shown any signs of illness recently. I do meet with various clients and colleagues for work, but none of them have reported being sick recently either. I try to maintain good hygiene practices, washing my hands frequently and avoiding close contact with people who appear to be sick. However, I can't rule out the possibility of being exposed to someone who was sick without knowing it, as I sometimes interact with people in public places.
