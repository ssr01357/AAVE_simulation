He can't talk right now, Doc. He done been havin' this sharp pain on the right side of his chest, and he be strugglin' to breathe somethin' awful. It just started, like, 10 minutes 'fore the ambulance got here. He moanin' and holdin' his chest. He ain't never had this happen before, but he do got asthma and emphysema.
||
I don't know ‘bout no procedures, Doc. He ain't said nothin' ‘bout that lately. But he been dealin' with his asthma and emphysema for years now, so it steady gives him trouble sometimes. Ain't nothin' major happened in the past year that I know of, though.
||
Far as I know, he be takin' some inhalers for his asthma and emphysema, but I ain't sure the names of 'em. He don't never really talk 'bout takin' nothin' else, though. Might be best to check with him once he can talk, but right now, I ain't got more to tell you.
||
I ain't heard him say nothin' 'bout havin' no allergies, Doc. Far as I know, he don't got none. If he do, he ain't never mentioned it to me or anyone at work.
||
Nah, he ain't been nowhere recent. He just been workin' at the truckin' company like usual. He ain't the type to travel much, just stays local, y'know?
||
Not that I know of, Doc. He be workin' with the same folks every day at the truckin' company, and ain't nobody mentioned bein' sick or nothin'. He ain't said nothin' 'bout feelin' bad 'fore this neither.
