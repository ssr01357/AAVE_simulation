I've been having increasing pain and swelling in my knees over the past week. It's been getting worse, and I thought I should come in to get it checked.

No, I haven’t had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. The only procedures I’ve ever had were related to childbirth, but that was at ages 31, 26, and 22. Other than that, I don’t have a history of medical problems.

Yes, I’m currently taking an oral contraceptive. For the pain, I’ve been using acetaminophen, but it only provides minimal relief, bringing my pain down just a little, from a 5 to a 4 on a 10-point scale. I’m not taking any herbal supplements or other medications.

I don’t have any allergies.

No, I haven’t traveled anywhere recently. I’ve mostly been at home or busy with my small business and taking care of my family.

No, I haven’t been around anyone who’s been sick recently, and I don’t know of any infectious exposures.
