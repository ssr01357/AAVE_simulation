I’ve been having this really sharp pain on the left side of my chest. It started suddenly about 45 minutes ago, and it’s been very intense—about an 8 out of 10. The pain is also going up to my jaw and into my back. I feel a bit short of breath and mildly nauseated, but it doesn’t get worse when I breathe or change my position. I haven’t had anything like this before, and I’m really worried.
