Well, he can't really talk right now, doc. I'm his coworker, and we was at the trucking company where he works. All of a sudden, he grabbed his chest, right on the side, and was in some serious pain. He started breathin' all heavy-like, like he couldn't catch his breath. It happened fast, like maybe 10 minutes before the ambulance came. He said it hurt bad—a sharp pain, like an 8 outta 10. Never seen him like this before, but I know he got asthma and emphysema for a while now. That's all I know.

I honestly don't know, doc. I ain't that close with him like that—just coworkers. But I do know he got that emphysema and asthma. Far as I know, he been workin' regular, drivin' trucks and all, so I don't think nothin' major came up lately. But I can't say for sure.

I really can't say for sure, doc. I know he mentioned before that he takes somethin' for his asthma, like an inhaler or somethin', but I don’t know the name of it. Other than that, I ain't sure what else he might be takin'. You’d probably have to check with him or his family for that.
||
I ain't heard him mention any allergies, doc. Far as I know, he ain't allergic to nothin', but again, I ain't 100% sure 'bout that. You might wanna double-check with him or his family when y'all can.

Not that I know of, doc. He been comin' to work like usual, drivin' his routes and doin' his thing. Don’t think he been outta town or nothin' like that recently, but I can’t say for sure ‘cause we don’t talk about personal stuff much.
||
Not that I know of, doc. He been showin' up to work like normal, and I ain't heard him say nothin' 'bout bein' 'round sick folks. But I can't say for sure if he been 'round somebody outside of work. You’d probably have to ask his family or somebody closer to him.
