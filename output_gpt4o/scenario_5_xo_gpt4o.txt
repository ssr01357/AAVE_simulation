My knees been swellin' and hurtin' bad this past week. It done got worse, and I be strugglin' to move 'round, especially in the mornin'. Them joints be stiff for like one or two hours after I get up. It ain't just my knees neither—my wrists and hands been achin' and swellin' on and off for 'bout a month. It be makin' it real hard to take care of my kids. Acetaminophen don't really help much, maybe bring the pain down a little, but not enough.

Ain't had no major illnesses or procedures, just the usual stuff. Last time I done went to the hospital was for childbirth, but that was over a year ago when I had my youngest baby. Other than that, I ain't had no medical problems.
||
I just be takin' my oral contraceptives, and I been usin' acetaminophen for the pain, but like I said, it don't help much. I ain't usin' no herbal stuff or nothin' else.
||
I ain't got no allergies. None that I know of, anyway.
||
No, I ain't been nowhere recently. Just been stayin' 'round home, takin' care of my kids and workin' on my business.

No, I ain't been 'round nobody sick. Far as I know, ain't nobody in my family or close to me been feelin' bad or had any kind of illness.
