She been feelin' real bad, doc. Had nausea and been throwin' up all day yesterday. Now she all drowsy and don’t got much energy. She ain't eat nothin’ at all since yesterday 'cause of how sick she been feelin'. I got real worried when she started actin' all out of it, so I brought her in.
||
Far as I know, she ain't had nothin' major happen to her ’sides her diabetes. She be takin’ insulin every day, but she ain't done had none in the past 24 hours 'cause of how sick she been. I don’t know 'bout no other illnesses or procedures.
||
She only be takin’ her insulin, far as I know. She don’t be usin' no other meds, over-the-counter stuff, or herbal things. And she ain’t into no drugs or nothin' like that.
||
I don’t know if she got any allergies. She ain’t never mentioned nothin' like that to me.
||
Far as I know, she ain’t been nowhere recently. She mostly just be at work or at home. Ain’t mentioned no trips or nothin'.
||
I don’t think so. She ain’t said nothin’ ‘bout bein’ ‘round anybody sick, and I ain’t seen her hangin’ with no one who looked unwell.
