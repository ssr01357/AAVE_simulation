Well, I’m her roommate, so I brung her in 'cause she been throwin’ up all day yesterday an' now she actin’ all drowsy an' out of it. She ain’t ate nothin' yesterday 'cause of the nausea an' vomitin’. It just got worse, so I figured I had to bring her in. She got diabetes an' usually take her insulin a lot, but she ain’t had none in the past day.
||
Far as I know, nah, she ain’t had no major illnesses or nothin’ like that. Only thing I know is she got that diabetes, an’ she usually real good 'bout takin’ her insulin. I ain’t heard her talk 'bout no procedures or nothin’ recent.
||
Nah, she don’t take nothin’ else. Just her insulin for her diabetes, but like I said, she ain’t took none in the last 24 hours. She don’t mess with no herbs or over-the-counter stuff neither.
||
I don’t think she got no allergies. Least, she ain’t never mentioned none to me.
||
Nah, she ain’t been nowhere recently. She mostly just be at work or at home. Ain’t no trips or nothin’ like that.
||
Not that I know of. She ain’t said nothin’ 'bout bein’ 'round nobody sick. We just been at the house or she at work, so I don’t think so.
