I’m her husband. She had a seizure about 10 minutes ago and lost consciousness. She’s awake now but seems really confused. She’s 38 weeks pregnant, and this has never happened before. She’s also been complaining of a really bad headache for the past three days, and I’ve noticed her feet have been swollen for the past couple of weeks. I was really scared when I saw her having the seizure, so I brought her here right away.

No, she hasn’t had any procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. She’s been healthy overall and hasn’t been hospitalized or treated for anything serious before. The pregnancy has been going well until now, with no complications during her prenatal visits.

Yes, she’s only taking prenatal vitamins. She’s not on any other medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements.
||
She doesn’t have any allergies that we know of.
||
No, she hasn’t traveled anywhere recently. She’s been staying at home and going to her prenatal appointments as usual.

No, not that I’m aware of. She hasn’t mentioned being around anyone who’s been sick, and we’ve mostly been staying home or going to routine appointments.
