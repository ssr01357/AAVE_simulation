Well, my lil' boy been havin' trouble breathin', doctor. It started 'bout three days ago. He be wheezin' real bad, and his cough done got worse too. Seem like when he play outside, it get worse, an' then when he come inside, it calm down some. It ain't the first time this done happened neither—he been wheezin' after playin' outside off an' on this past year. I just ain't sure what’s goin' on.

Nah, he ain't had no major illnesses lately. But when he was 2, he had to stay in the hospital for a whole week 'cause of the same kinda thing—shortness of breath an' a bad cough. They gave him antibiotics through an IV an' some oxygen back then. Also, when he was 'bout 18 months, he had them tubes put in his ears 'cause he kept gettin' ear infections. Other than that, he been doin' okay, ‘cept for this breathin' stuff and his skin actin' up sometimes from that eczema.

He just usin' that steroid cream for his skin, you know, for the eczema. Other than that, he ain't takin' nothin' else right now. We ain't been givin' him no over-the-counter stuff or nothin' like that.
||
He ain't got no food allergies or nothin' like that, but he do got a problem with pollen. It make his eyes all watery an' itchy when he be outside, specially in the spring an' summer. I think that might be why he be havin' trouble sometimes when he play in the yard.
||
Nah, we ain't been nowhere lately. We just been stayin' round here, mostly at home or in the yard. Ain't gone no trips or nothin' like that.

Ain't nobody 'round us been sick lately. His sister, me, his daddy—we all been feelin' fine. He ain't been 'round no sick folks far as I know.
