Well, doc, my knees been hurtin’ real bad, and they been swellin’ up too, especially this past week. It's been makin’ it real hard to get through the day, takin’ care of my kids and all. The pain’s just been gettin’ worse.
||
Nah, I ain’t had no big illnesses or procedures lately. The only time I been in the hospital was when I had my kids, but that was a while back. Other than that, I been pretty healthy.
||
Yeah, I’m takin’ my birth control pills. And I been tryin’ acetaminophen for the pain, but it don’t really do much. It helps a lil’ bit, but the pain still there. I ain’t takin’ nothin’ else though.
||
I ain’t got no allergies that I know of, doc. Ain’t never had no bad reactions to nothin’.
||
Nah, I ain’t been nowhere, just stayin’ around home, takin’ care of my family and runnin’ my lil’ business. Ain’t had no time for travelin’.
||
Nope, not that I know of. Ain’t nobody around me been sick, far as I can tell. Everybody in the house been feelin’ fine.
