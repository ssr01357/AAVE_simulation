My son has been having increasing shortness of breath and wheezing over the past three days. He also has a cough that's been getting worse. I’ve noticed he seems to cough more after playing outside. This has happened before—he often wheezes after playing in the backyard, but it usually gets better once he comes inside. This time, it’s not improving, so I brought him in.

No, he hasn’t had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. The last time he had a significant issue was when he was hospitalized at age 2 for similar symptoms—shortness of breath and a cough. Before that, he had pressure equalization tubes inserted at 18 months due to frequent ear infections. Other than that, nothing major recently.

The only medication he’s currently using is a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. He’s not taking any other medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements.
||
He’s allergic to pollen—it causes watery eyes and itching. Those are the only allergies I’m aware of.
||
No, he hasn’t traveled anywhere recently. We’ve just been at home and around the neighborhood.

No, not that I know of. No one in our family or around him has been sick recently.
