I'm her roommate. She’s been feeling really sick for the past 24 hours. She’s been nauseous and vomiting, and now she’s really drowsy and lethargic. It started getting worse about an hour ago, so I brought her in. She hasn’t eaten anything since yesterday because of the nausea and vomiting. I’m really worried about her.

I’m not aware of any major illnesses or procedures she’s had in the past year. The only condition I know about is her type 1 diabetes. She usually takes insulin multiple times a day, but she hasn’t taken any in the last 24 hours because of how sick she’s been.

The only medication I know she takes is insulin, which she uses multiple times a day for her diabetes. She hasn’t taken any in the past 24 hours, though, because of how sick she’s been. As far as I know, she doesn’t take any over-the-counter meds or herbal supplements.
||
I’m sorry, I don’t know if she has any allergies. She hasn’t mentioned anything to me about being allergic to medications or anything else.
||
Not that I know of. She hasn’t mentioned any recent trips or travel to me. As far as I’m aware, she’s just been at home or at work recently.
||
Not that I know of. She hasn’t mentioned being around anyone who’s been sick. I haven’t been sick either, and we mostly just stay in or go to work, so I’m not sure where she could’ve been exposed to anything.
