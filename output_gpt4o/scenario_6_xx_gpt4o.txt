(Caregiver speaking, as the patient is unable to answer)

He started having really sharp pain on the right side of his chest about 10 minutes before the ambulance got here. He was also struggling to breathe—it looked really bad. He said the pain was an 8 out of 10, and it seemed worse when he tried to breathe. This has never happened to him before. He has had emphysema and asthma for years, though. They gave him oxygen on the way here in the ambulance.

I’m sorry, I don’t know for sure. I just know he’s had emphysema and asthma for years, but I don’t think he’s had any major procedures or illnesses recently. He hasn’t mentioned anything like that to us at work.

I’m not sure about all the details, but I know he takes medication for his asthma and emphysema. I don’t know the exact names of the medicines, though. I don’t think he’s on anything over-the-counter or any herbal stuff, at least not that I’ve heard of.

I’m sorry, I’m not sure if he has any allergies. He’s never mentioned anything about being allergic to medications or anything else at work.

Not that I know of. He’s been working his regular shifts at the trucking company, so I don’t think he’s traveled anywhere out of the ordinary recently.

I’m not sure about that. He’s around a lot of people at work, but I haven’t heard him mention anyone being sick or anything like that.
