Well, doc, I’m here ‘cause I got this real bad pain in my chest, over on the left side. It started all of a sudden, ‘bout 45 minutes ago. It’s sharp, and it’s hurtin’ real bad—like an 8 outta 10 bad. It’s spreadin’ to my jaw and my back too. I’m breathin’ kinda short, but it don’t get worse when I breathe or move ‘round. I’m feelin’ a lil’ nauseous too, but I ain’t had no palpitations or feelin’ like I’m ‘bout to pass out.
||
Naw, I ain’t had nothin’ like that in the past year. Ain’t been in the hospital or nothin’. I just take my meds for my high blood pressure, but other than that, I been good.
||
Yeah, I’m takin’ that lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure. I don’t take nothin’ else—no over-the-counter stuff or herbs or nothin’ like that. Just those two.
||
I ain’t got no allergies, doc. None that I know of, at least.
||
Naw, I ain’t been nowhere recently. I just been stayin’ ‘round home, doin’ my usual stuff like walkin’ and playin’ bridge.
||
Naw, I don’t think so. Ain’t nobody ‘round me been sick far as I know. I try to keep to myself mostly, ‘cept for seein’ my kids or some folks at bridge. Ain’t heard ‘bout nobody feelin’ bad.
