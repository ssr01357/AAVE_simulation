*I can't talk, so imma let my coworker answer for me.*  

Coworker: "Well, doc, he was at work drivin' trucks, and out the blue, he just grabbed his chest and started strugglin’ to breathe. He was holdin’ his right side and groanin', sayin' it hurt real bad. He told me it was sharp feelin', and he rated it like an 8 outta 10. It got worse when he tried to breathe in. This ain't never happened to him before, but I know he been had emphysema and asthma for a long time. That’s all I know, really. Ambulance gave him some oxygen on the way here."
||
Coworker: "I ain't really sure 'bout all that, doc. I mean, he ain’t told me nothin’ 'bout no big procedures or illnesses lately. He just be dealin’ with that asthma and emphysema stuff for years now. If he had somethin’ major, he ain’t say nothin’ to me 'bout it."
||
Coworker: "I ain't sure 'bout all the meds he takin', doc. I know he be usin’ them inhalers for his asthma or emphysema, but I couldn’t tell you the names of 'em or nothin’ like that. As for other stuff, I don’t really know. He don’t really talk 'bout that kinda thing at work."
||
Coworker: "Man, I ain’t heard him say nothin’ 'bout havin’ no allergies. Far as I know, he don’t got none, but I can’t say for sure. He ain’t never mentioned it to me."
||
Coworker: "Nah, he ain’t been nowhere lately. He just be workin’ at the truckin’ company, same ol’ routine every day. Ain’t said nothin’ 'bout no trips or travelin’."
||
Coworker: "Not that I know of, doc. He be at work most the time, just doin’ his truckin’ job. Ain't nobody at work been real sick or nothin’ like that, far as I done seen."
