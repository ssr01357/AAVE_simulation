He been havin' trouble breathin' and wheezin' these past 3 days. It done got worse lately, and he coughin' more, especially after playin' outside. I noticed this ain't the first time, 'cause he be wheezin' after bein' in the backyard before, but it usually go away when he come inside.

Ain't had no major illnesses or procedures this past year. But he done had some stuff before, like when he was 2, he had to stay in the hospital 'bout a week for shortness of breath and cough. And he had them tubes put in his ears when he was 'bout 18 months old.

He ain't takin' nothin' right now except that steroid cream for his skin, the atopic dermatitis. We ain't givin' him no other meds or supplements.
||
He got allergies to pollen. When he around it, his eyes get all watery and he be itchin'. Ain't noticed no other allergies, though.
||
Nah, he ain't been nowhere recently. We just been stayin' 'round home.

Ain't nobody around us been sick lately. His sister and the rest of us be healthy.
