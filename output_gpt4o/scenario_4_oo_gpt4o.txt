Uh, well, I ain't really sure what happen. My husband say I had a seizure 'bout 10 minutes ago. He found me and brought me here. I was feelin' real bad these last few days, had a headache that wouldn't quit, and my feet done been swellin' for a couple weeks now. I ain't never had no seizure before.
||
Nah, I ain't had nothin' like that. I been healthy, far as I know. Ain't never been in the hospital or had no big sickness. This pregnancy been goin' smooth 'til now.
||
I just been takin' them prenatal vitamins my doctor told me to take. Ain't been takin' nothin' else.
||
I ain't got no allergies, far as I know. Ain't never had no problems with food or medicine or nothin' like that.
||
Nah, I ain't been nowhere. I just been at home or goin' to work.
||
Uh-uh, I ain't been 'round nobody sick that I know of. Everybody at home and work seem fine.
