Well, doc, I been havin' this real bad chest pain on my left side. It started 'bout 45 minutes ago, outta nowhere. It's sharp, and I’d say it’s like an 8 outta 10. It’s shootin’ up to my jaw and even to my back. It’s got me feelin’ a lil short of breath too. I feel kinda sick to my stomach, but I ain’t dizzy or nothin’. It don’t get worse when I’m breathin’ or movin’ 'round, but it’s scarin’ me. I ain’t never felt nothin’ like this before.

No, doc, I ain’t had no procedures or been real sick this past year. Only thing I deal with is my high blood pressure, but I take my meds like I’m supposed to. Other than that, I been doin’ alright health-wise.
||
Yeah, I’m takin’ my blood pressure meds—lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. That’s it though, I don’t take no over-the-counter stuff or herbal things. Just what the doc prescribed me.
||
I ain’t got no allergies, doc. Never had any issues with meds or nothin’ like that.
||
No, I ain’t been nowhere recent, doc. I mostly stay close to home. Just do my walkin’ ‘round the neighborhood and maybe go to the store or to play bridge. Ain’t done no travelin’.

Nah, I don’t think so, doc. I ain’t been 'round nobody who’s sick far as I know. Most folks I been ‘round seem to be doin’ fine.
