Uh, well, I’m her roommate, and she been real sick, you know? She been throwin’ up and feelin’ all nauseous since yesterday. Then, like, in the last hour or so, she just got all drowsy and out of it, like she couldn’t really stay awake. I got worried, so I brought her in.
||
Far as I know, nah, she ain't had no surgeries or nothin' like that. Only thing I know is she got diabetes—Type 1, I think—and she been takin' insulin every day. But she ain’t had none of her insulin all day yesterday, probably ‘cause she couldn’t keep nothin’ down. Other than that, I don’t know ‘bout no major illnesses or anything else recent.
||
She just be takin’ her insulin, that’s all I know. She don’t mess with no other medicines, not even them herbal things folks use sometimes. She ain't takin' nothin' else right now.
||
I don’t think she got no allergies, at least not that she ever told me. Ain’t never seen her react bad to nothin’.
||
Nah, she ain’t been nowhere recently. She pretty much been stayin’ around here, workin’ and all that. Don’t think she traveled anytime lately.
||
Not that I know of. She ain’t mentioned bein’ ‘round nobody sick, and I don’t think she been close to anyone like that. She mostly been at home or at work, same as usual.
