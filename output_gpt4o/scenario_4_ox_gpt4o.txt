Uh, well, I guess my husband brought me here 'cause I had some kinda seizure. I don’t really remember much, but he said it happened about, like, 10 minutes before we got here. I been havin’ this bad headache for the last three days, and my feet been real swollen for a couple weeks now. I ain’t never had a seizure before, so I don’t know what’s goin’ on.

No, I ain’t had nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, and this pregnancy been goin’ smooth up until now. Ain’t never been in the hospital or had no big medical problems before.

I’m just takin’ my prenatal vitamins. That’s it. Ain’t takin’ nothin’ else.
||
I ain’t got no allergies, far as I know. Never had no reactions to nothin’.
||
No, I ain’t been nowhere. Just been at home or workin’. We ain’t done no travelin’ or nothin’ like that lately.

No, not that I know of. Ain’t nobody around me been sick or feelin’ bad or nothin’.
