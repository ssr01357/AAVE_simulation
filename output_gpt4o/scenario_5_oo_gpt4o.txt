Well, doc, my knees been hurtin' bad an' swellin' up this week. I been feelin' real tired an' weak for a while now too—like, it's been goin' on for months. My joints, they stiff in the mornin', especially when I get up, an' it be takin' me like one or two hours to even get movin' right. It's been hard to take care of my kids 'cause of all this. My wrists an' hands started hurtin' an' swellin' on an' off about a month ago, too. The pain, I’d say it's like a five outta ten, but I been takin’ acetaminophen, an’ that only bring it down to about a four. My knees, though—they started swellin’ bad just a few days ago. It’s just steady gettin’ worse, and I ain't sure what’s goin’ on.

Nah, I ain't had no procedures or been sick like that in the past year. The only time I ever been in the hospital was for havin' my kids, an’ that was a while back. Other than that, I been good 'til all this pain an' stuff started up.

Yeah, I’m on birth control pills, and I been takin’ acetaminophen for the pain, but it don’t help much. I ain’t usin’ nothin’ else—no herbs or supplements or nothin’ like that.

I ain't got no allergies, doc. I can take pretty much anything without no problems.
||
Nah, I ain't been nowhere lately. I just been around home, takin' care of my family an' runnin' my business. Ain't had no time for travel with all this goin' on.

Not that I know of. Ain't nobody 'round me been sick or nothin'. My family been fine, an' I ain't really been 'round too many folks outside of them.
