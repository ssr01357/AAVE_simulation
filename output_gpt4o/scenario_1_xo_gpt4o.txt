I got this sharp pain in my chest, on the left side. It come on all of a sudden 'bout 45 minutes ago. It’s bad—like an 8 outta 10. It goin’ up to my jaw and around to my back too. I feel a lil’ short of breath and kinda nauseated, but it don’t get worse when I breathe or move around. I ain’t had nothin’ like this before.

Nah, I ain’t had no procedures or major illnesses in the past year. Only thing I got is my high blood pressure, but I been takin’ my meds for that regular.
||
Yeah, I’m takin’ that combination pill—lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide—for my blood pressure. Ain’t takin’ nothin’ else though, no over-the-counter stuff or herbal things.
||
I ain’t got no allergies. None that I know of.
||
Nope, I ain’t been nowhere recently. Just stayin’ local, doin’ my usual stuff like walkin’ and playin’ bridge.

Nah, I ain’t been 'round nobody sick lately. Far as I know, everybody I been with doin’ fine.
