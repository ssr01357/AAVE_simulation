Well, my baby boy been havin' a hard time breathin' the past few days. He’s been wheezin’ a lot, and it’s gettin’ worse. He got this cough too, especially after he been playin’ outside. I just knew somethin’ ain't right, so I brought him in.

Not in the past year, no. But when he was younger, he had some stuff goin’ on. He was in the hospital when he was 2 for somethin’ like this—strugglin’ to breathe and coughin’. He was there for a week and had to get antibiotics and oxygen. And when he was a baby, he had a lotta ear infections, so they put them tubes in his ears when he was ‘bout 18 months old. But nothin' major recently.
||
The only thing he usin’ right now is that steroid cream for his skin. He got atopic dermatitis, so sometimes his skin flares up, and we gotta use it. Other than that, he ain’t takin’ nothin’.
||
He got allergies to pollen. It makes his eyes all watery and itchy, especially when he’s outside. We ain’t noticed no food or medicine allergies though, just that pollen messin’ with him.
||
No, we ain’t been nowhere recently. We been stayin' close to home, just doin’ our usual stuff.
||
Not that I know of. Ain’t nobody around us been sick, far as I can tell. His sister’s fine, and we all been feelin’ okay at home.
