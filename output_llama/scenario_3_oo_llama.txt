Doc, my roommate brought me in. I been feelin' real bad, ya hear? I had nausea and vomiting for like, the past 24 hours, and now I'm feelin' all drowsy and lethargic. I ain't been able to keep nothin' down, not even water. And I missed my insulin shots, too. I got diabetes, type 1, and I usually take my insulin multiple times a day, but I ain't had none in the past 24 hours. My roommate said I been actin' real strange, too, just layin' here in a fetal position and whatnot. I'm finna pass out or somethin' if we don't get this figured out, doc.

Nah, doc, I ain't had no major procedures or nothin' like that in the past 12 months. I been managin' my diabetes pretty good, just takin' my insulin and checkin' my blood sugar like I'm supposed to. I had a cold or two, but that's about it. I been steady goin' to my doctor's appointments, too, to make sure my diabetes is under control. But, you know, I been feelin' kinda off lately, and I ain't been able to eat nothin' for a day or so, and that's why my roommate brought me in. She say I been actin' real weird, and she got worried 'bout me.

Doc, I'm on insulin, like I said, for my diabetes. That's the only medication I'm takin' regular. I ain't takin' no over-the-counter stuff or no herbal supplements or nothin' like that. I might take some Tylenol or somethin' if I got a headache, but that's about it. And I ain't been takin' my insulin for the past 24 hours, like I said, 'cause I been feelin' so bad. My roommate, she don't know all my medical stuff, but she know I take insulin, and she been tryin' to get me to take it, but I just ain't been able to, ya hear?
||
Doc, I ain't got no allergies that I know of. I mean, I ain't never had no reaction to no medication or no food or nothin' like that. My roommate, she ain't mentioned nothin' about me havin' no allergies, neither. I been around all kinds of things, and I ain't never had no problem. I'm good with all kinds of medication, too, 'cept I don't take none of that stuff regular, 'cept my insulin, like I said. So, nah, I don't think I got no allergies, doc.
||
Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I been right here in the city, just goin' to work and come back home. I work in advertising sales, and I ain't had no business trips or nothin' like that in a while. I been steady at home, just chillin' with my roommate and whatnot. I ain't been exposed to nothin' out of the ordinary, just the usual city stuff. My roommate, she might've gone out and about, but I been laid up, feelin' bad, so I ain't been nowhere, doc.
||
Doc, now that you mention it, my roommate, she been sayin' that her sister been sick with somethin' lately. I don't know what it was, but she been talkin' about how her sister been feelin' bad, had a fever and whatnot. I ain't been around her sister or nothin', but my roommate, she been takin' care of me and whatnot, so I guess it's possible I could've gotten somethin' from her, if she was around her sister and then came around me. But I ain't think nothin' of it, 'cause I just thought I was feelin' bad 'cause of my diabetes, ya hear?
