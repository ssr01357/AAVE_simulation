My baby's been havin' a real hard time breathin' lately, doc. He's been wheezin' somethin' awful, and it's been gettin' worse over the past few days. He's also been coughin' a lot, especially after he plays outside. I'm gettin' real worried 'bout him, 'cause this ain't the first time he's had these kinda symptoms. He had somethin' similar when he was 2, and he had to go to the hospital for it. I just wanna make sure he's okay, ya know?

No, doc, nothin' major in the past 12 months, thank God. But like I mentioned earlier, he did have them "wheezy bronchitis" episodes when he was a baby, and he had to get them tubes put in his ears when he was 18 months old. That was a while back, though. Recently, he's just been dealin' with this atopic dermatitis, and we've been usin' a steroid cream to help with that. Other than that, he's been pretty healthy, just these respiratory issues that seem to come and go.

Yeah, doc, like I said, he's been usin' that steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. That's the only medication he's on right now. We don't give him no over-the-counter stuff or no herbal supplements, nothin' like that. Just the cream, and that's it. His pediatrician prescribed it for him, and we've been usin' it as directed. We try to keep it simple and only give him what the doctor says is okay, ya know?

My baby's got a little allergy to pollen, doc. Whenever he's around it, he gets them watery eyes and starts itchín' like crazy. It's pretty mild, but it's somethin' we've noticed, especially when we're outdoors and the pollen count is high. Other than that, he don't have no other allergies that we know of. We've been keepin' an eye on him, and that's the only thing that seems to bother him, pollen-wise.

No, doc, we ain't been nowhere recently. We've been stayin' right here in the city, just doin' our regular thing. We went to my sister's house for a barbecue last weekend, but that's about it. We didn't go on no trips or nothin' like that. He's been playin' in the backyard, like I said, and that's when he seems to have the most trouble with his breathin' and wheezin'. But we ain't been nowhere out of the ordinary, just our usual routine.

Let me think on that for a sec, doc... My sister's kid, my baby's cousin, she had a cold last week, but I don't think my baby was around her when she was sick. And my husband, he's been workin' a lot, but he ain't been sick or nothin'. I'm the one who's been takin' care of my baby mostly, and I've been feelin' fine. I don't think he's been around nobody who's been sick, but we did go to the park on Saturday, and there was a lot of kids there, so I guess it's possible he could've been exposed to somethin' then. But nobody in our household's been sick, if that's what you're askin'.
