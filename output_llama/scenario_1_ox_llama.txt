Doc, I'm havin' this awful pain in my chest, on the left side. It's sharp, like somebody's stabbin' me or somethin'. It started 'bout 45 minutes ago, outta nowhere. I was just sittin' there, mindin' my bizness, and then suddenly I'm feelin' like I gotta catch my breath. It's radiatin' to my jaw and my back, too. I'm gettin' a little anxious, 'cause I don't know what's goin' on. I'd say the pain's about an 8 outta 10, and I'm feelin' a little nauseous, too. I was hopin' you could help me figure out what's goin' on and make this pain stop.

No, doc, nothin' major in the past 12 months. I've just been goin' to my regular check-ups, gettin' my blood pressure checked and whatnot. I have been takin' my meds like I'm supposed to, though - my lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure. I've had that under control for years, thank the Lord. I did have a couple of C-sections back in the day, when I was havin' my babies, but that was ages ago - 32 and 27, I think. Other than that, nothin' too out of the ordinary. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin' older, you know? But this chest pain, it's somethin' different. It's got me worried, doc.

Yeah, doc, I'm takin' my blood pressure meds like I said before - lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. That's a combination pill, so it's just one pill a day. I've been takin' it for years, and it's been workin' just fine. I don't take no over-the-counter stuff regular, just maybe some Tylenol every now and then if I got a headache or somethin'. And I don't do no herbal supplements, neither. My doctor told me to just stick with my prescribed meds, and I've been doin' that. Oh, and I do have a glass of wine with dinner every night, but that's about it. I don't smoke, and I don't take no other kinda substances, so I think that's it, doc.

Doc, I don't have no allergies that I know of. I ain't never had no problems with medications, foods, or nothin' like that. I've had my fair share of vaccinations and whatnot, and I ain't never had no reactions to none of 'em. My doctor's always askin' me about allergies, and I always tell 'em the same thing: I don't have none. So, you can put that down as "none", doc.

Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I'm a homebody, mostly. I like to stay close to home, take care of my garden, and play some bridge with my friends. I did go to my granddaughter's birthday party last weekend, but that was just across town, so that don't count as travelin', right? (laughs) I ain't been on no planes, trains, or nothin' like that in a long time. I'm a simple woman, doc, I like to keep things simple.

Let me think on that for a sec, doc... I don't think so, no. I've been around my family, but they're all doin' fine. My kids and grandkids, they're all healthy, praise the Lord. I did go to church last Sunday, but I don't recall nobody bein' sick or nothin'. I mean, we had a potluck dinner, but everybody seemed fine. I ain't been around nobody with no fever, cough, or nothin' like that. I'm a pretty social person, but I don't think I've been exposed to nobody who's been sick recently, doc.
