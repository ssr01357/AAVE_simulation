He be in a lot of pain, doc. He had sharp chest pain and respiratory distress, it been happenin' about 10 minutes before we got here. He can't talk right now, but I been with him, I'm his coworker. He got emphysema and asthma, had them for years, but this never happened before. They gave him oxygen on the way here. He be holdin' his chest and moanin', sayin' it hurt when he breathe.

He had asthma attacks, been to the hospital for them, but no major procedures, doc. He been managin' his emphysema with medication, but he ain't had no surgeries or nothin' like that in the past year. He been steady goin' to his doctor appointments, gettin' his check-ups, but nothin' out the ordinary, just his regular treatments for his conditions. His wife, she be the one who usually take care of him, but she ain't here right now, so I'm fillin' in, tryin' to help out.

He be takin' his inhalers for his asthma, and he been takin' some medication for his emphysema, doc. I think it's them steroids, but I ain't exactly sure, his wife be the one who keep track of all that. He also be takin' some over-the-counter stuff for his allergies, but I don't know what kind, it's them pills he get from the store. He ain't never mentioned no herbal supplements, so I don't think he be takin' none of them. He had them medications with him at work, but I didn't bring 'em with me to the hospital, they still back at the truckin' company.

He be allergic to dust, pollen, and them strong chemicals, doc. He got real bad reactions to 'em, it make his asthma act up somethin' fierce. He also be allergic to some medications, but I don't know what kind, his wife be the one who know all that. He had a bad reaction to somethin' a while back, and she be the one who took care of him, got him to the hospital and all. She be the one who know what he can and can't take, but like I said, she ain't here right now. He just be takin' them over-the-counter pills for his allergies, but I don't know what's in 'em, it's just what he been takin' for years, and it been workin' for him, till now, I guess.

He been on the road a lot, doc, he be a truck driver, so he been to a lot of different places. He just got back from a trip out west, he been drivin' through them states, like Texas and Arizona, and he been gone for a while, like a week or so. He also been to them places up north, like Chicago and Detroit, but that been a few weeks ago. He be on the road all the time, so it's hard to keep track of where he been, but he ain't been out the country or nothin' like that. He just be drivin' from place to place, haulin' them goods and whatnot. His wife be the one who keep track of his schedule, she be the one who know where he be and when he be comin' back.
||
He been around a lot of people, doc, he be at them truck stops and restaurants, and he be around his coworkers, so it's possible he been exposed to somebody who's sick. He didn't say nothin' about nobody bein' sick, but he did say he been feelin' a little off for a day or two before this happened. He been coughin' and sneezin' some, but we just thought it was his allergies actin' up again. He ain't been around nobody with nothin' serious, that I know of, but like I said, he be around a lot of people, so it's hard to say for sure. His wife be the one who usually ask him about that kind of thing, but she ain't here, so I'm just tellin' you what I know.
