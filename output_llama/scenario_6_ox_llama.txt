(coworker speaking on behalf of the patient) Ahh, doc, my man here... he was at work, ya know, drivin' trucks, and suddenly he just clutched his chest and started moanin' in pain. He said it was sharp, like a stabbin' feelin' on the right side. He couldn't breathe neither, was havin' a lot of trouble catchin' his breath. We called 911 right away, 'cause we knew somethin' was serious wrong. They gave him some oxygen on the way here, but... (looks at the patient with concern) ...he ain't been able to talk much since it happened. (shakes head) This is scary, doc. He's been dealin' with emphysema and asthma for years, but nothin' like this has ever happened before.
||
(coworker speaking on behalf of the patient) Yeah, doc... let me think on that for a sec. (pauses) Okay, so he's been in the hospital a few times for his asthma, ya know, when it flares up real bad. And he's had to get them steroid shots and oxygen therapy to help him breathe. But as for procedures... (thinks) ...I think he had a lung function test, like, 6 months ago? And he's been seein' a specialist for his emphysema, gettin' checked out regular. But no surgeries or nothin' like that in the past year, far as I know. (looks at the patient) He's been managin' his conditions pretty good, but... (shakes head) ...this is somethin' different, doc. This is bad.
||
(coworker speaking on behalf of the patient) Oh, yeah... he's on a bunch of meds, doc. Let me see if I can remember 'em all. (thinks) He's on an inhaler for his asthma, and he takes some pills for his emphysema... I think it's called Spiriva? And he's also on a steroid, like, a preventative medicine to help with his breathing. (pauses) He might be takin' some other stuff too, but I ain't entirely sure. He's got a whole list of 'em at home, but I know he's been takin' some aspirin and acetaminophen for pain and whatnot. And, uh, I think he might be takin' some ginkgo biloba and vitamin D supplements, 'cause his wife is always on him about takin' care of himself. (looks at the patient) But, for real, doc, I don't think he's been takin' nothin' out of the ordinary, just his regular meds. (shrugs) You might wanna ask his wife, though, she's the one who keeps track of all that stuff.
||
(coworker speaking on behalf of the patient) Ahh, allergies... let me think on that, doc. (pauses) I know he's allergic to penicillin, 'cause he had a bad reaction to it one time when he was younger. And I think he's also allergic to sulfa drugs, somethin' like that. (nods) Yeah, that's right. His wife told me about that one time when we was talkin' about his meds. (thinks) I don't know if he's got any other allergies, but them's the two that come to mind. (looks at the patient) You might wanna check with his wife or his medical records to make sure, though. She's the one who's always on top of that stuff. (shrugs) I'm just tryin' to help out, doc.
||
(coworker speaking on behalf of the patient) Travelin'? Nah, doc, he ain't been nowhere exotic or nothin'. He's been workin' his regular route, drivin' trucks from state to state, but nothin' out of the country or nothin' like that. (thinks) He did just get back from a run to Chicago, though, like, a few days ago. But that's just a regular trip for him, he does that all the time. (shrugs) He might've stopped at some truck stops or rest areas along the way, but I don't think he's been exposed to nothin' out of the ordinary. (looks at the patient) He's just been doin' his thing, workin' hard, and then... (gestures to the patient) ...this happens. It's like, out of nowhere, doc.
||
(coworker speaking on behalf of the patient) Ahh, exposed to someone sick? (thinks) Now that you mention it, doc, his wife was feelin' a little under the weather last week. She had a cold or somethin', but nothin' too serious. And one of the guys he works with, his name's Joe, he's been out sick for a few days with the flu. (nods) Yeah, that's right. My man here was just talkin' about how Joe was out and how they was short-staffed. But I don't think he was around Joe too much, 'cause Joe's been out for a bit. (pauses) And then there's the truck stop, doc. He stops at them truck stops all the time, and you never know who's been in and out of there. (shrugs) He could've picked up somethin' from someone there, but I don't know for sure. (looks at the patient) He's always been careful, though, washin' his hands and whatnot. (sighs) I just don't know, doc. This is all just so sudden.
