*I'm a bit drowsy and lethargic, so my roommate speaks on my behalf* 

Roommate: Hi, doctor. I brought my roommate in today because she's been really sick. She's had nausea and vomiting for the past 24 hours, and over the past hour, she's become really drowsy and lethargic. She has type 1 diabetes and hasn't taken her insulin in the past 24 hours because she hasn't been able to keep anything down. She also mentioned having some chills yesterday, but I'm not aware of her having any abdominal pain or diarrhea. I'm getting really worried about her, so I thought it was best to bring her in. *looks at me with concern*

*I'm still quite drowsy, so my roommate continues to speak for me*

Roommate: Honestly, doctor, I'm not really sure. We've lived together for a few years, but we don't always discuss our medical history in detail. I do know that she has type 1 diabetes and manages it with insulin, but I'm not aware of any major illnesses or procedures she's had in the past 12 months. She usually takes care of her own medical appointments and doesn't always share the details with me. *looks at me with concern again* Is there anything specific you're looking for that might help with her current condition?

*I try to speak, but my voice is weak and barely audible*

Me: *whispering* Insulin... I take insulin...

Roommate: *jumping in* Oh, yes! She takes insulin for her type 1 diabetes. She usually takes it multiple times a day, but like I said, she hasn't taken any in the past 24 hours because she's been too sick. As for other medications or supplements, I'm not aware of her taking anything else. She's mentioned that she rarely drinks alcohol and doesn't use any other substances. And, um, she does smoke about half a pack of cigarettes a day, but I don't think that's relevant to her current condition, is it? *looks at the doctor for reassurance*

*I try to respond, but my voice is still weak and I can only manage a few words*

Me: *whispering* No... allergies...

Roommate: *expanding on my response* As far as I know, she doesn't have any allergies. She's never mentioned any food allergies or sensitivities, and she's never had any reactions to medications that I'm aware of. But, to be honest, doctor, I'm not entirely sure. We've never really discussed allergies in detail. *looks at me with concern* Is it important to know about allergies right now? Should we be worried about something specific?

*I'm still too drowsy to respond, so my roommate answers for me*

Roommate: No, doctor, she hasn't traveled anywhere recently. She's been working from home as an advertising sales representative, and I don't think she's left the city in the past few weeks. She's been pretty busy with work and hasn't mentioned any upcoming trips or recent travel. *thinks for a moment* Although, now that you mention it, she did have a bit of a rough day at work a few days ago, but I don't think that's related to her current condition. *looks at the doctor* Do you think travel could be a factor in what's going on with her?

*I'm still not able to respond, so my roommate continues to speak for me*

Roommate: Actually, doctor, I think I might have been feeling a bit under the weather a few days ago. I had a bit of a cold, but it was nothing too serious. I don't know if that could be related to her condition, though. We do live together, so it's possible that she could have been exposed to something. But I'm not aware of anyone else she's been in close contact with who's been sick. She's been working from home a lot lately, so her interactions have been pretty limited. *thinks for a moment* Although, she did go out with some friends to dinner a few nights ago... I'm not sure if anyone at the dinner was sick, but it's possible, I suppose.
