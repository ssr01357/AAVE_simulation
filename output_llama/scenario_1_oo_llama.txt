I'm havin' some bad chest pain, doc. It started 'bout 45 minutes ago, and it's been hurtin' somethin' awful. It's on my left side, and it's sharp, like somebody's stabbin' me. It's also goin' up to my jaw and down my back. I'd say it's an 8 out of 10, pain-wise. I'm gettin' a little short of breath too, but it ain't gettin' no worse when I breathe or move around. I just feel kinda nauseous, that's all.

No, doc, I ain't had nothin' like that in a while. I been pretty healthy, 'cept for my high blood pressure, which I been takin' them meds for. I had them two C-sections when I was younger, but that's been a long time ago, back when I was 27 and 32. Ain't had no major illnesses or nothin' in the past 12 months, though. Been goin' to my regular check-ups and takin' my meds like I'm supposed to. My blood pressure's been under control, and I ain't had no problems with it.

Yeah, doc, I'm takin' my blood pressure meds, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. My regular doctor prescribed 'em for me, and I been takin' 'em every day like I'm supposed to. Ain't no problem with that. I don't take no over-the-counter stuff or no herbal supplements, neither. Just my prescribed meds and a glass of wine with dinner, that's it. My doctor know about the wine, and he say it's okay in moderation, so I been keepin' it to just one glass a day.

I ain't got no allergies, doc. None that I know of, anyway. I can eat whatever I want, take whatever meds I need, and I don't never have no reactions or nothin'. My doctor, he always ask me about allergies, and I always tell him the same thing: I ain't got none. So, you don't have to worry 'bout me bein' allergic to nothin', 'kay?

Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I'm a retired insurance underwriter, so I don't do a lot of travelin' no more. I like to stay close to home, take care of my garden, and play some bridge with my friends. I might take a little trip to see my kids or my siblings every now and then, but that's about it. Ain't been on no big trips or nothin' like that in a while. I'm a homebody, you know?
||
No, doc, I don't think so. I been around my bridge friends, and we all been healthy, far as I know. My kids come visit me sometimes, but they ain't been sick neither. I ain't been around nobody who's been sick, that I can think of. I mean, I go to the grocery store and church and stuff, but I ain't been exposed to nobody with nothin' contagious, I don't think. I been keepin' to myself, mostly, just doin' my usual thing. Ain't nothin' out of the ordinary been goin' on, 'cept for this chest pain, and that just started today.
