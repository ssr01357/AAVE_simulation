Doc, my husband brought me in. I had a seizure, and I don't know, it's all kinda fuzzy. He said I was shakin' and stuff, and then I passed out. I've been havin' these real bad headaches for the past few days, and my feet been swollen somethin' awful. I'm 38 weeks pregnant, so I figured it was just part of bein' pregnant, but I guess it's more than that. My husband said I need to get checked out, so here I am.

No, doc, nothin' like that. I've just been goin' to my regular prenatal check-ups, and everythin' seemed fine. I ain't had no major illnesses or no procedures done. Just been takin' my prenatal vitamins like I'm supposed to. This pregnancy's been pretty smooth sailin' till now, with these headaches and all. My last prenatal visit was just two weeks ago, and everythin' was good then. My blood pressure was fine, and the baby was doin' great. I don't know what's goin' on now, but I'm gettin' a little worried.

Doc, yeah... I'm just takin' my prenatal vitamins, like I said. That's it. No other medications, no nothin' over-the-counter, no herbal supplements. Just them prenatal vitamins. My doctor told me to take 'em, and I been takin' 'em regular. I ain't one to take no medicine unless I really need it, and I been feelin' pretty good till these headaches started. My husband, he's always tellin' me to take care of myself, 'specially now that I'm pregnant, so I been stickin' to just them vitamins.

Doc, I don't have no allergies that I know of. I ain't never had no problems with no foods, no medicines, no nothin'. My husband, he's got a allergy to shellfish, but I don't have none. I been around all kinds of things, and I never had no reaction or nothin'. So, to answer your question, I don't have no allergies.

No, doc, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I've been stickin' close to home, takin' it easy, 'specially since I'm so far along in my pregnancy. My husband and I, we like to go horseback ridin' sometimes, but that's just out at the stables near our house. We ain't gone on no big trips or nothin' like that. Just been keepin' it low-key, waitin' for the baby to come.

Doc, let me think... I don't think so. I've been around my husband, and he's been healthy. I go to work as a nursin' assistant, but I ain't been to work for a little while now, just takin' it easy before the baby comes. I did have a coworker who was out sick with somethin' a few weeks ago, but I don't think I was around her when she was sick. And I ain't been around nobody else who's been sick that I can think of. My husband and I, we just been keepin' to ourselves, just chillin' at home, waitin' for the baby.
