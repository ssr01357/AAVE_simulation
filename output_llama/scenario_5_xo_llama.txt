I been havin' a lot of pain and swelling in my knees, doc. It started about a week ago, and it's been gettin' worse. My knees be swollen, and it's hard for me to move around, especially in the mornin'. I also been havin' some pain in my wrists and hands, and I been feelin' real tired and weak for a while now. I tried takin' some acetaminophen, but it only helps a little bit. I'm worried 'bout takin' care of my family, 'cause it's hard for me to do all the things I need to do when I'm in pain like this.

No, doc, I ain't had no major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. I did have a baby about a year ago, when I was 31, but that's about it. I been pretty healthy, just been dealin' with this fatigue and joint pain for a few months now. My babies be 3, 7, and 10, so I been busy takin' care of them, but I ain't had no other health problems lately. I been takin' my oral contraceptive, and I been goin' to my regular check-ups, but that's about it.

Yeah, doc, I be takin' my oral contraceptive, like I said before. That's the only prescription medication I'm on. As for over-the-counter, I been takin' some acetaminophen for the pain, but that's about it. I ain't takin' no herbal supplements or nothin' like that. I don't really take no medicine unless I really need to, 'cause I'm busy with my kids and my business, and I try to stay healthy by eatin' right and gettin' enough rest. But like I said, the acetaminophen ain't been doin' much for my pain, so I'm hopin' we can figure out what's goin' on and find somethin' that'll help me feel better.

I don't have no allergies, doc. I ain't allergic to no medicines, no foods, no nothin'. I been lucky that way, I guess. My kids, they be fine too, no allergies or nothin'. So, we don't have to worry 'bout that.

No, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I been stayin' right here, takin' care of my family and my business. I don't get to travel much, 'cause it's hard to leave my kids and my husband, and I gotta keep my business goin'. I might go to my mom's house or my sister's house sometimes, but that's about it. I ain't been on no plane or no nothin' like that in a long time. I been right here, just dealin' with my daily routine and tryin' to stay healthy.

No, doc, I don't think so. My kids, they be in school, so they be around a lot of people, but they ain't been sick or nothin'. My husband, he be healthy too. We ain't had no visitors or nothin' that I can think of. I been to the church, though, and I sang in the choir last Sunday, but I don't think nobody there was sick. I ain't been around nobody that's been sick, that I know of. I been tryin' to take care of myself, 'specially with my kids and everythin', so I try to avoid people who be sick.
