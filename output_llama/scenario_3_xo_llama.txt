I been feelin' real bad, doc. I had nausea and vomiting for the past 24 hours, and now I'm feelin' drowsy and lethargic. My roommate had to bring me in 'cause I ain't been able to take care of myself. I also got diabetes, and I hadn't taken my insulin in the past 24 hours, so I'm worried 'bout that too.

I ain't had no major procedures or illnesses in the past 12 months, doc. Just been dealin' with my diabetes, and I been managin' it with insulin. My roommate say I been doin' okay with it, but I had a real bad episode now, and I don't know what's goin' on. I had some chills yesterday, but that's about it. I bin takin' care of myself, but I guess I missed my insulin doses yesterday and today, and now I'm feelin' real bad.

I be takin' insulin for my diabetes, doc. That's my main medication. I ain't takin' no other prescription meds, over-the-counter meds, or no herbal supplements. Just my insulin, and like I said, I hadn't taken it in the past 24 hours, so I'm finna get back on track with that. My roommate say I rarely drink, and I don't use no other substances, so it's just my insulin I'm concerned 'bout right now.
||
I ain't got no known allergies, doc. My roommate say I never had no reactions to no foods, meds, or nothin' like that. I been around all sorts of things, and I never had no problems. I just got my diabetes, and that's what I been managin' with insulin. I don't know if that's relevant, but I figured I'd mention it.

I ain't been nowhere recently, doc. I been steady at home, workin' as an advertising sales representative, and just dealin' with my daily routine. I hadn't traveled nowhere in a while, so I don't think that's what's causin' my problems. I been just tryin' to manage my diabetes and do my job, but then I started feelin' bad yesterday and it just got worse.

I don't think so, doc. I been around my roommate, but she ain't been sick or nothin'. We been just chillin' at home, and I ain't been around nobody else who's been sick. I had some clients at work, but I don't recall nobody bein' sick or nothin'. I been pretty much just at home or at work, so I don't think I been exposed to nobody with nothin' contagious. My roommate say she ain't been around nobody sick neither, so we ain't sure what's goin' on with me.
