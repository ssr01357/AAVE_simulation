My husband brought me in. I had a seizure, and I been feelin' real bad. I had a severe headache for the past few days, and my feet been swollen for a while now. I don't know what's goin' on, but I been feelin' kinda confused too. My husband said I lost consciousness for a little bit, but I don't remember that part.

No, I ain't had none of them. I been goin' to my prenatal appointments regular, and they all been sayin' my pregnancy been goin' good. I had a check-up two weeks ago, and everythin' was fine. I been takin' my prenatal vitamins like I'm supposed to, and I ain't had no problems till these headaches started. My mom, she had endometrial cancer a couple years ago, but I ain't had nothin' like that.
||
I'm only takin' my prenatal vitamins, that's it. I ain't takin' no other medications or nothin' like that. My doctor told me to take them, so I been takin' them regular. I don't take no over-the-counter stuff or herbal supplements, 'cause I'm tryin' to be careful with my pregnancy. I been doin' everything my doctor say, so I don't think I'm takin' nothin' that could be hurtin' me or my baby.

I ain't got no allergies, none that I know of, anyway. I never had no problems with no foods, medicines, or nothin' like that. My husband, he got allergies, but I don't. I been around all kinds of things, and I never had no reaction or nothin'.
||
No, I ain't been nowhere recently. I been stayin' home, takin' care of myself, and gettin' ready for the baby. Me and my husband, we went to my sister-in-law's house for dinner last weekend, but that's about it. I ain't been on no trips or nothin' like that. I been pretty much stickin' around the house, just restin' and tryin' to stay comfortable.
||
I don't think so, I ain't been around nobody who's been sick. My husband, he been workin' and comin' home, and he ain't been sick or nothin'. I been seein' my family and friends, but they all been fine too. I did go to the grocery store a few days ago, but I ain't been in no big crowds or nothin' like that. I been tryin' to stay away from people who might be sick, 'cause I don't wanna get nothin' that could hurt my baby.
