Doc, I'm so glad to be here. I been dealin' with this pain and swelling in my knees for 'bout a week now, and it's been gettin' worse. It's hard for me to take care of my kids and run my business when I'm feelin' like this. My knees be all swollen and hurtin' somethin' awful. And it ain't just my knees, neither. My wrists and hands been hurtin' too, for a few weeks now. I been takin' some acetaminophen, but it only helps a little bit. I'm hopin' you can help me figure out what's goin' on and get me feelin' better soon.

No, doc, nothin' major in the past 12 months. I did have a baby about a year ago, though - my third one. That was a pretty routine pregnancy and delivery, thank God. But other than that, I ain't had no surgeries or nothin' like that. Just been dealin' with these aches and pains that I mentioned earlier. And like I said, they started out pretty mild, but they've been gettin' worse over time. My energy levels been down too, and I just feel like I'm tired all the time. But I ain't had no major illnesses or nothin' that I know of, doc.

Yeah, doc, I'm takin' my birth control pills, just like I have been for years. That's the only prescription medication I'm on. And like I mentioned earlier, I've been takin' some acetaminophen for the pain, but that's just as needed, you know? I ain't takin' it every day or nothin'. I don't really take no herbal supplements or nothin' like that, neither. I'm pretty straightforward when it comes to medication, doc. I only take what my doctor tells me to take, and that's it. Oh, and I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. Just when I remember to, you know?

Doc, I don't have no allergies that I know of. I ain't never had no reactions to no medicines or foods or nothin' like that. My doctor's always asked me about allergies, and I always tell 'em the same thing: I don't have none. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. I can eat whatever I want, take whatever medicine I need, and I don't have to worry 'bout no allergic reactions. So, to answer your question, doc, I don't have no allergies.

No, doc, I ain't traveled nowhere recently. I've been stickin' close to home, takin' care of my kids and runnin' my business. I don't really get a chance to travel much, to be honest. My husband and I, we might take a little trip to see our families sometimes, but that's about it. And even that's been a while, 'cause with three kids, it's hard to get away, you know? So, no, I ain't been nowhere exotic or nothin' like that. Just been right here at home, dealin' with my daily routine.

Doc, now that you mention it, my kids been goin' back and forth to school, and you know how that is - they're always bringin' home some kind of germ. But nothin' that's stuck with 'em for too long, thank God. My youngest had a cold a few weeks ago, but that's about it. And my husband, he's been healthy too. I ain't been around nobody that's been really sick, like with nothin' contagious or nothin'. Just the usual kid stuff, you know? But I did have to take my kids to the pediatrician's office a few weeks ago, and there were a lot of sick kids there, waitin' to be seen. So, I guess it's possible I could've been exposed to somethin' there, but I ain't had no fever or nothin' like that, so...I don't know, doc. Could that have somethin' to do with what's goin' on with me?
