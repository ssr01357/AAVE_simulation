Lawd, my coworker gonna have to tell you, doc, 'cause I'm in too much pain to talk. He been with me since this happened, so he know what's goin' on. (moaning) Oh, man... this pain in my chest, it be killin' me... (coworker steps in) 

Coworker: Yeah, doc, we was at work, and he just started complainin' 'bout sharp pain in his chest, and then he couldn't breathe right. We had to call the ambulance, 'cause it seemed like it was gettin' worse by the minute. He been dealin' with emphysema and asthma for years, but nothin' like this never happened before.

Coworker: Nah, doc, he ain't had no major procedures or nothin' like that in the past year, but he been dealin' with them emphysema and asthma attacks steady. He had to go to the hospital a few times for treatments, but nothin' too serious, just them regular check-ups and medications. He been managin' it, but it seem like it been gettin' worse lately. He had a bad asthma attack 'bout 6 months ago, and he had to be hospitalized for a few days, but he been doin' alright since then. (to the patient) You ain't had no other problems, right? (patient moans in response) 

Coworker: Sorry, doc, he can't talk right now, but like I said, he been dealin' with them breathing problems for years, and we been keepin' up with his appointments and medications. His doctor been keepin' an eye on him, but nothin' like this never happened before.

Coworker: Yeah, doc, he be takin' a bunch of medications for his emphysema and asthma. He got an inhaler, and he take some pills too. Let me see... (rummages through patient's bag) He got his albuterol inhaler, and he take some prednisone, and... (reads from a piece of paper) ...some spiriva and symbicort. He also take some over-the-counter stuff like acetaminophen for pain, and he been takin' some vitamin D supplements too. His doctor told him to take 'em, so he been takin' 'em regular. (to the patient) You ain't forgettin' to take none of your meds, was you? (patient moans in response)

Coworker: Sorry, doc, like I said, he can't talk right now. But I can give you the names of all his medications and the doses if you need 'em. I got the list right here. (pulls out a piece of paper) His wife, she be the one who usually keep track of all his meds, but she ain't here right now. She told me what he been takin', though.

Coworker: Let me think... he be allergic to penicillin, and he got a bad reaction to sulfa drugs one time. He also allergic to shellfish, and he can't eat none of that. His wife, she be the one who always remind him what he can and can't take. (looks at the patient) You ain't got no other allergies, did you? (patient moans) 

Coworker: Sorry, doc, like I said, he can't talk right now. But I'm pretty sure them's the only allergies he got. We had to fill out one of them allergy forms at the doctor's office one time, and I think that's what his wife put down. (pauses) Yeah, and he also got a latex allergy, I think. He had a reaction to one of them latex gloves at the hospital one time, and they had to switch to them non-latex ones.

Coworker: Nah, doc, he ain't been nowhere recently. He been workin' steady at the truckin' company, just drivin' around the city and whatnot. He didn't go on no trips or nothin' like that. He been home every night, 'cept for when he had to drive out to the suburbs for work. He didn't go outta state or nothin' like that. (thinks for a moment) Wait, he did go to his cousin's house in the country for a barbecue 'bout a month ago, but that's 'bout it. He ain't been nowhere exotic or nothin' that would make him sick, I don't think. (looks at the patient) You ain't been nowhere else, have you? (patient moans) 

Coworker: Sorry, doc, like I said, he can't talk right now. But I'm pretty sure that's all the travelin' he done recently. His wife, she might know more, but she ain't here right now.

Coworker: Yeah, doc, his grandson been sick with somethin' last week. He had a bad cold, and he been coughin' and sneezin' all over the place. My man been around him, too, 'cause he been helpin' out with the grandkids while his wife been workin'. He been takin' care of 'em, and they been around him, so it's possible he mighta caught somethin' from his grandson. But I don't think it's nothin' too serious, 'cause his grandson just had a cold, and he been gettin' better now. (thinks for a moment) And his coworker, Joe, been out sick for a few days too. He had somethin' with a fever, and he been missin' work. My man been workin' with him, so it's possible he mighta got somethin' from him too. But like I said, doc, he been dealin' with them emphysema and asthma attacks, so it's hard to say what's goin' on with him right now.
