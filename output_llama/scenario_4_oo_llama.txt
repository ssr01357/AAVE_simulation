My husband brought me in, doc. I had a seizure, ya hear? I was just sittin' there, and then I don't know, I just started shakin' and convulsin' or somethin'. My husband said it lasted a few minutes, but I don't remember none of it. And for the past few days, I been havin' this real bad headache, it been steady hurtin' me somethin' awful. My feet been swollen too, for like two or three weeks now. I'm 38 weeks pregnant, so I figured it was just the baby and all, but I guess it's somethin' more serious, huh?

Nah, doc, I ain't had none of that. I been pretty healthy, just the usual prenatal check-ups and whatnot. My pregnancy been goin' smooth, no complications or nothin'. I take my prenatal vitamins like I'm supposed to, and I been goin' to all my appointments. I had a check-up just two weeks ago, and everythin' was fine. My blood pressure was good, and the baby was doin' good too. But now, with this seizure and all, I'm gettin' a little worried, ya know?

Doc, I'm only takin' them prenatal vitamins, that's it. I ain't takin' nothin' else, no over-the-counter meds, no herbal supplements, nothin' like that. My doctor told me to just stick with the prenatal vitamins, and I been doin' that. I don't even take no Tylenol or nothin' for them headaches I been havin', 'cause I didn't want to take no chances with the baby. My husband been tellin' me to take somethin' for the pain, but I been tryin' to just tough it out, ya hear?

I ain't got no allergies, doc. None that I know of, anyway. I can eat whatever I want, take whatever meds I need, and I don't never have no reactions or nothin'. My husband always sayin' I'm lucky, 'cause he got all kinds of allergies and sensitivities. But me, I'm good, I don't have none of that. They asked me about allergies when I was gettin' my prenatal care, and I told 'em the same thing, I ain't got none.

Nah, doc, I ain't been nowhere. I been stayin' right here, close to home, 'cause I'm so far along in my pregnancy. My husband and I was thinkin' 'bout takin' a little trip, just a weekend getaway or somethin', but then I started feelin' them headaches and my feet got all swollen, so we just decided to stay put. I ain't been nowhere exotic or nothin', just to the grocery store, the park, and my prenatal appointments, that's it. I been keepin' it real low-key, just waitin' for the baby to come, ya hear?

Doc, I don't think so... I been around my husband, and he been healthy, ain't nothin' wrong with him. And I go to my mom's house sometimes, but she ain't been sick neither. I did go to work, though - I'm a nursin' assistant - but that was a couple weeks ago, before I started feelin' so bad. I don't remember nobody bein' sick around me at work, but I guess it's possible. My husband been takin' care of me, makin' sure I don't get exposed to nothin', 'cause we don't want nothin' to happen to the baby, ya hear?
