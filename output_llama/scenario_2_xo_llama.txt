My child been havin' a real hard time breathin' lately, doc. He been wheezin' and coughin' a lot, specially after he play outside. It been goin' on for 'bout 3 days now, and it seem like it's gettin' worse. He had them symptoms before, but this time it seem different, so I figured I'd bring him in to get checked out.

No, doc, he ain't had no major illnesses in the past 12 months. But he did have them ear tubes put in when he was 18 months old, and he was hospitalized for a week when he was 2 years old 'cause of shortness of breath and cough, similar to what he's goin' through now. They gave him some IV antibiotics and oxygen then. That's 'bout it, though. He been seein' the doctor regular for check-ups and shots, and he's up to date on all his vaccinations.

Yeah, doc, he be takin' a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. That's 'bout it, though. He ain't takin' no other medications, over-the-counter or nothin' like that. Just the cream for his skin, and we use it like the doctor told us to, when his skin get bad.
||
He be allergic to pollen, doc. It make his eyes get all watery and itchy. That's 'bout the only allergy we know of, though. We noticed it when he play outside and then he come in with them watery eyes. Ain't no food allergies or nothin' like that, just the pollen.

No, doc, he ain't been nowhere recently. We been stayin' right here at home, just goin' to school and playin' in the backyard, that's it. We ain't took no trips or nothin' like that. He just been doin' his regular thing, but like I said, he been havin' them breathing problems and wheezin' a lot, specially after he play outside.

No, doc, he ain't been around nobody who's been sick. His sister, she's 3, and she's been healthy, and me and his daddy, we been healthy too. We ain't had no visitors or nothin' like that who's been sick. He just been goin' to school and comin' home, and like I said, he been havin' them problems after he play outside, so I'm thinkin' it might be somethin' out there that's botherin' him.
