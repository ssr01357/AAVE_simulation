Doctor, I'm her roommate, and I brought her in 'cause she ain't been doin' too good. She's been throwin' up and feelin' nauseous for like, a day now, and just in the past hour or so, she started gettin' all drowsy and lethargic. She's been complainin' 'bout feelin' real bad, and I got worried 'cause she's a diabetic, ya know? She usually takes her insulin and all, but she hasn't had none in the past day. I'm gettin' real scared, doc, 'cause she's just layin' there, not respondin' like herself.

Doc, to be honest wit' you, I don't know 'bout no procedures or major illnesses in the past 12 months. We've been roommates for 'bout 6 months now, and she's always been pretty private 'bout her medical stuff. I know she's been managin' her diabetes, takin' her insulin and all, but that's 'bout it. She ain't never really talked 'bout no other health issues or nothin' like that. She's always been pretty healthy, far as I know, 'cept for the diabetes, of course. But like I said, she's been actin' real strange today, and I'm gettin' worried somethin' might be goin' on that I don't know 'bout.

Yeah, doc, she's been takin' her insulin, like I said before. That's the only medication I know of, though. She's real particular 'bout takin' that, 'cause of her diabetes and all. I ain't never seen her take no over-the-counter meds or no herbal supplements, but I could be wrong, ya know? She might be takin' somethin' I don't know 'bout. But insulin's the only thing I'm sure of, 'cause she's always talkin' 'bout needin' to take that. And like I said, she hasn't had none of that in the past 24 hours, which is why I'm gettin' all worried and stuff.

Doc, I don't know if she got any allergies, to be honest wit' you. She ain't never mentioned nothin' 'bout bein' allergic to nothin' to me. And I ain't seen her have no reactions or nothin' like that. She's always been pretty normal, far as I know. But, like I said, we ain't been roommates for that long, so I might not know everythin' 'bout her. I wish I could help more, but I just don't know 'bout no allergies, doc. You might wanna check her medical records or somethin' to see if it's in there, I guess.

Doc, now that you mention it, yeah... she did go outta town last weekend. She went to visit her sister in Atlanta, I think it was. She came back on Sunday, and she seemed fine then. But then she started feelin' bad yesterday, with the nausea and vomiting and all. I don't know if it's related to her trip or not, but it's the only thing that's changed recently, far as I know. She didn't say nothin' 'bout gettin' sick or exposed to nobody while she was there, but... I don't know, maybe it's somethin' she picked up? I'm just speculatin', doc, but I figured I'd mention it, just in case.

Doc, now that you ask... yeah, her sister's kid was sick when she went to visit. I think she said the kid had a fever and was throwin' up, too. She didn't think nothin' of it at the time, but now that she's sick, I'm wonderin' if maybe she caught somethin' from the kid. She was helpin' take care of the kid and all, so it's possible, right? And she did say she had some chills yesterday, which made me think of the flu or somethin'. But I don't know, doc, I'm no expert. I'm just tryin' to piece together what might've happened. You think it could be somethin' she caught from her niece or nephew?
