I been havin' this real bad chest pain, doc. It started 'bout 45 minutes ago, and it's been steady hurtin' me somethin' awful. It's on my left side, and it radiate to my jaw and back. I'd say it's an 8 out of 10, pain-wise. I'm gettin' a little short of breath, too, but it ain't gettin' no worse when I breathe or move around. I just feel kinda nauseated, that's all. Ain't no fever, cough, or nothin' like that, though.

No, doc, I ain't had nothin' major in the past 12 months. I been pretty healthy, considerin' my age. I had them babies, my kids, by C-section, but that was years ago, when I was 27 and 32. I been takin' my meds for my blood pressure, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, like I'm supposed to. I ain't had no problems with that. My blood pressure been under control, mostly. I had it checked at my last doctor's visit, and it was fine. I been feelin' pretty good, till this chest pain started, that is.

Yeah, doc, I been takin' my blood pressure meds, like I said. That's lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, and I been takin' 'em for 'bout 5 years now. I ain't takin' nothin' else, no over-the-counter stuff, no herbal supplements, nothin' like that. Just them two meds, and I been takin' 'em just like my doctor told me to. I ain't got no allergies or nothin', so I don't have to worry 'bout that. And I have a glass of wine with dinner every night, but that's it, doc. I don't smoke, I don't take no other medicines... just them two, and my wine.

Doc, I ain't got no allergies. None whatsoever. I ain't never had no problems with medications, foods, or nothin' like that. My doctor always ask me 'bout allergies, and I always tell 'em the same thing: I ain't got none. So, you don't gotta worry 'bout me havin' no allergic reactions or nothin' like that.

No, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I been stayin' right here at home, just doin' my usual thing. I walk a couple miles a day, play some bridge with my friends... nothin' out of the ordinary. I ain't traveled nowhere in a while, just local stuff. I ain't been on no planes, no trains, no nothin' like that. Just been right here, till this chest pain started, that is.

No, doc, I don't think so. I been around my family, my friends, and them's about it. None of 'em been sick, far as I know. I mean, I see my kids and my friends pretty regular, but nobody been complainin' 'bout nothin'. I ain't been around nobody with no fever, no cough, no nothin' like that. I been pretty careful, too, 'cause I know I'm gettin' up there in age, and I don't wanna get sick. But I ain't been exposed to nobody that I know of, doc.
