(nervously) Oh, doctor... I'm having this terrible chest pain. It's on my left side and it's very sharp. It started about 45 minutes ago, and it's been getting worse. The pain is also radiating to my left jaw and my back. I'm feeling a bit short of breath, but it doesn't seem to get worse when I breathe or move around. I'm also feeling a bit nauseous. (taking a deep breath) It's very scary, doctor. I've never had anything like this before.
||
(shaking head) No, doctor. I haven't had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. I've been pretty healthy, just my regular check-ups with my primary care physician to manage my hypertension. I've been taking my medication, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, as prescribed, and I haven't had any issues with that. (pausing, thinking) I did have two cesarean deliveries a long time ago, when my children were born, but that was many years ago. Does that count?
||
Yes, doctor. I'm currently taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for my high blood pressure. I take them as prescribed by my doctor, and I've been taking them for about 5 years now. I don't take any other prescription medications. As for over-the-counter medications, I occasionally take acetaminophen for headaches, but that's about it. And I don't take any herbal supplements. I do drink one glass of wine with dinner every day, but that's my only regular habit besides my medication. (looking concerned) Do you think any of this could be related to my chest pain?
||
(shaking head) None, doctor. I don't have any allergies. I've never had any adverse reactions to medications or foods, and I've never been diagnosed with any allergies. My medical history is pretty straightforward, and allergies have never been a concern for me.
||
(thinking) No, doctor. I haven't traveled anywhere recently. I'm a bit of a homebody, and I like to stay close to home. I do play tournament bridge with my friends, and we occasionally go to different venues for tournaments, but those are all local. I haven't taken any long trips or traveled out of state in a while. (pausing) I do walk 2 to 3 miles a day, just around my neighborhood, but that's about the extent of my traveling lately.
||
(thinking) No, doctor. I don't think so. I've been around my bridge friends, but none of them have been sick that I know of. I've also been around my family, my children and their families, but they're all healthy. I don't really have much exposure to people who are sick, except maybe occasionally at the grocery store or something, but I don't think that would be a significant exposure. (shaking head) I've been feeling fine until this chest pain started, so I don't think I've been exposed to anything that would have made me sick.
