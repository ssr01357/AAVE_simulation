My knees been hurtin' somethin' awful, doc. They swell up real bad, and it's hard for me to move 'em in the mornin'. Been like that for 'bout a week now. And I gotta say, it's been gettin' worse. I had some pain in my wrists and hands too, but my knees is where it's hurtin' the most. I tried takin' some acetaminophen, but it only help a little bit. I'm hopin' you can help me figure out what's goin' on and get me some relief, 'cause it's hard to take care of my family like this.

No, doc, I ain't had nothin' like that in the past year. I did have a baby, though - my third one - but that was a while back, when I was 31. That was a pretty normal delivery, no complications or nothin'. Other than that, I been pretty healthy, just been dealin' with this fatigue and joint pain for a few months now. It's been steady gettin' worse, and I'm gettin' a little worried 'bout what might be goin' on.

Yeah, doc, I'm takin' birth control pills, oral contraceptive. That's the only medication I'm on right now. I ain't takin' no herbal supplements or nothin' like that. Just them birth control pills and the acetaminophen I mentioned earlier when my joints be hurtin'. I don't take no other medicines, 'cause I don't like takin' a whole lotta pills, you know? I try to keep it simple.

I ain't got no allergies, doc. None that I know of, anyway. I can eat whatever I want, take whatever medicine I need, and I don't never have no problems. My kids, they got some allergies, but I don't. So, you don't gotta worry 'bout me havin' no allergic reactions or nothin' like that.

No, doc, I ain't been nowhere recently. I been right here in the city, takin' care of my family and runnin' my small business. I ain't had no time for travelin' or nothin' like that. My kids keep me busy enough, and my business keep me on my toes, so I ain't been nowhere exotic or out of the ordinary. Just the usual routine, you know?
||
Nah, doc, I don't think so. My kids, they be around other kids at school, so they might've been exposed to somethin', but they ain't been sick or nothin'. My husband, he be healthy too. We ain't had nobody in the house been sick recently. I been around my church family, though - I sing in the choir - but nobody been talkin' 'bout bein' sick or nothin'. So, I don't think I been exposed to nothin' that would make me sick, 'less it's somethin' that's been goin' around that nobody know about.
