Doctor, I've been experiencing a lot of pain and swelling in my knees over the past week, and it's been getting worse. To be honest, I've been having some issues with joint pain and stiffness for a while now, especially in the mornings. It's been making it hard for me to take care of my family and do my daily activities. I've tried taking acetaminophen, but it only helps a little bit. I'm hoping you can help me figure out what's going on and find a way to make the pain more manageable.

No, Doctor. I haven't had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. My last significant medical event was giving birth to my third child about 1 year ago, when I was 31. That was a normal childbirth, and I didn't have any complications. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, just dealing with this increasing fatigue, weakness, and joint pain over the past few months.

Yes, Doctor. I'm currently taking an oral contraceptive. That's the only prescription medication I'm on. As for over-the-counter medications, I've been taking acetaminophen occasionally to try to manage my joint pain, but like I mentioned earlier, it only provides minimal relief. I'm not taking any herbal supplements.

I don't have any allergies, Doctor. I'm not allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors that I'm aware of.
||
No, Doctor. I haven't traveled anywhere recently. As a matter of fact, I've been pretty busy taking care of my family and running my small business, so I haven't had much opportunity to travel. I've been staying pretty local, just going about my daily routine and activities.

No, Doctor. I don't think so. My kids have had the usual colds and sniffles that come with school, but nothing out of the ordinary. And my husband and I have been healthy, aside from my joint pain and fatigue issues. I haven't been around anyone who's been seriously ill or had any kind of infectious disease that I'm aware of.
