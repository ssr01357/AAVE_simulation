My husband brought me in. I... I had a seizure, I think. I don't really remember what happened, but he said I was shaking and unresponsive for a few minutes. And I've been having a really bad headache for the past three days. It's been getting worse and worse. My feet have also been swollen for a couple of weeks, but I thought that was just because of the pregnancy. I'm 38 weeks along, and this is my first baby. I've been feeling a bit confused and disoriented since the seizure, to be honest.

No, I don't think so. I've just been going to my regular prenatal check-ups and everything has been normal. I've been taking my prenatal vitamins like I'm supposed to. I haven't had any major illnesses or procedures in the past 12 months. This pregnancy has been pretty straightforward until now, with the headache and the seizure. My last prenatal visit was just two weeks ago, and everything seemed fine then.

Just my prenatal vitamins. That's the only medication I'm taking. I've been instructed by my obstetrician to take them daily to support my pregnancy. I don't take any other medications, over-the-counter or herbal supplements. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body since I'm pregnant, so I only take what my doctor recommends.

I don't have any allergies. At least, none that I'm aware of. I've never had any reactions to medications or foods that I know of. My husband might know more, but as far as I know, I don't have any allergies. (looks at husband for confirmation)

No, I don't think so. We haven't really traveled anywhere out of the ordinary recently. Just our usual daily routine and maybe some occasional visits to see family and friends who live locally. We haven't gone on any trips or vacations since I've been pregnant. My husband and I have just been staying close to home and getting ready for the baby to arrive.

I don't think so. I work as a nursing assistant, so I'm around patients and healthcare workers all the time, but I haven't been exposed to anyone with anything contagious that I know of. We have to follow pretty strict protocols at work to prevent the spread of illness, so I'm pretty careful about that. And at home, my husband and I have just been keeping to ourselves, getting ready for the baby. We haven't had any visitors who were sick or anything like that. Although, I have been feeling really tired and having these headaches, but like I said, I thought it was just because of the pregnancy.
