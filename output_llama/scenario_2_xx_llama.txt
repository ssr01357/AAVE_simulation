(speaking as the mother) Oh, thank you for seeing us, Doctor. My son has been having a lot of trouble breathing and wheezing over the past three days. He's been coughing a lot too, and it seems to get worse when he plays outside. I've noticed this happen before, especially when he's been playing in the backyard, but this time it seems more severe. He's been having these episodes of wheezing and coughing since he was an infant, and I'm getting really worried. He was even hospitalized for it when he was two years old. I just want to make sure he's okay and get him feeling better.

(speaking as the mother) No, Doctor, nothing major in the past 12 months. He's been pretty healthy, just the usual colds and minor illnesses that kids get. However, I do want to mention that he did have some issues when he was younger. He had frequent episodes of "wheezy bronchitis" as an infant, and he had to be hospitalized for a week when he was two years old because of his breathing problems. He also had pressure equalization tubes inserted in his ears when he was 18 months old because of recurring ear infections. But like I said, in the past 12 months, he's been relatively healthy, just dealing with some occasional wheezing and coughing, especially when he's outside.

(speaking as the mother) Yes, Doctor. He's currently using a steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis. He's had eczema since he was a baby, and the cream really helps to keep it under control. Other than that, he's not taking any other medications or supplements. We do give him acetaminophen or ibuprofen occasionally when he has a fever or is feeling uncomfortable, but that's about it. And of course, he's up to date on all his vaccinations. Oh, and I should mention that he does have allergies to pollen, which can cause him to have watery eyes and itching, but we don't give him any regular medication for that. We just try to avoid exposing him to pollen as much as possible.
||
(speaking as the mother) He's allergic to pollen, Doctor. It makes his eyes get all watery and itchy. We've noticed it especially during the spring and summer months when the pollen counts are high. He doesn't have any food allergies or allergies to animals or anything like that, just the pollen allergy. And like I mentioned earlier, he does have eczema, which can be triggered by various things, but the pollen allergy is the only specific allergy we're aware of.
||
(speaking as the mother) No, Doctor, we haven't traveled anywhere recently. We've been sticking close to home, just doing our usual routine. He goes to preschool a few days a week, and we take him to the park or playground on the weekends, but we haven't taken any trips or gone out of town. He's been playing in our backyard a lot, though, and like I mentioned earlier, that's when his wheezing and coughing seem to get worse. But as for traveling, no, we haven't gone anywhere new or exciting lately. Just our usual daily routine.
||
(speaking as the mother) Actually, Doctor, his sister had a bit of a cold last week, but it was just a minor thing. She had a runny nose and a slight cough, but she's all better now. And I think one of his friends at preschool was out sick for a day or two, but I'm not sure what was wrong with him. Other than that, I don't think he's been exposed to anyone who's been really sick. His father and I have been healthy, and we've been trying to keep him away from anyone who might be contagious. But like I said, his sister did have a cold, and they do play together, so it's possible he might have been exposed to something through her.
