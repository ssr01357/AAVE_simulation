My baby been havin' a real hard time breathin' lately, doc. He been wheezin' and coughin' somethin' awful, specially after he play outside. It been goin' on for 'bout three days now, and it's gettin' worse. He had them symptoms before, but this time it's bin really bad. I'm gettin' worried 'bout him, y'all.

No, doc, my baby ain't had no major illnesses in the past 12 months, thank God. But he did have them ear tubes put in when he was 18 months old, and he was hospitalized for a week when he was 2 years old 'cause of his breathin' problems. They gave him some antibiotics and oxygen, and he got better. He also been gettin' them steroid creams for his atopic dermatitis, 'cause his skin get all dry and itchy sometimes. That's 'bout it, doc.

Yeah, doc, my baby been takin' that steroid cream for his atopic dermatitis, like I said before. That's 'bout it, though. He ain't takin' no other medications, over-the-counter or nothin' else. Just that cream, and it been helpin' his skin out a lot. His daddy and me, we been give it to him like the doctor told us to, and it been workin' fine. We ain't given him no herbal supplements or nothin' like that, neither.

My baby got allergies, doc. He allergic to pollen, and it make his eyes all watery and itchy. That's 'bout it, though. We noticed it when he play outside and then he come in with them watery eyes. We ain't seen no other allergies, but that pollen one be botherin' him somethin' awful, specially in the springtime.

Nah, doc, we ain't been nowhere recently. We been right here at home, just goin' 'bout our daily business. My baby been playin' in the backyard, goin' to daycare, and comin' back home. We ain't took no trips or nothin' like that. He been gettin' them symptoms right here at home, so I don't think it's from nowhere we been. It's just been happenin' after he play outside, that's all.

My baby's sister, she been snifflin' and coughin' a little bit, but that's 'bout it, doc. She ain't been real sick or nothin', just a little somethin' goin' around, I reckon. And my baby been around her, 'cause they play together and all. But I ain't think that's what's makin' him so sick, 'cause his symptoms been different. He been wheezin' and havin' a hard time breathin', and she ain't been doin' none of that. She just been got a little cold, that's all.
