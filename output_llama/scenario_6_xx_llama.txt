*makes moaning sounds, unable to speak, and holds hands over the right side of the chest, indicating severe pain* 

*A coworker, who accompanied the patient, steps in to provide information*

Coworker: He's having severe chest pain and trouble breathing. It started about 10 minutes before the ambulance arrived. He was at work at the trucking company when it happened. He's had emphysema and asthma for years, but this is the first time something like this has happened to him. The ambulance gave him oxygen on the way here. *looks concerned* He's really struggling to breathe and is in a lot of pain.

Coworker: To be honest, doctor, I don't know all the details about his medical history, but I do know he's been managing his emphysema and asthma for years. He's been to the doctor regularly for check-ups and treatments, but I'm not aware of any major procedures or illnesses in the past 12 months. He's been able to work and live with his condition, but this... *gestures to the patient* ...this is something different. He's never been in this much distress before. *looks at the patient with concern* Can you please help him?
||
Coworker: Ah, yes... I think so. He takes his inhalers for his asthma and emphysema, and I've seen him take some pills for his condition. I'm not sure what they're called, but I know he gets them from his doctor. He also takes some over-the-counter medication for his allergies, I think it's Claritin or something like that. And he might take some vitamins, but I'm not really sure. He's always been pretty private about his medication, so I don't know all the details. *looks at the patient* I wish he could tell you himself, but... *shakes head* He's just not able to right now.
||
Coworker: I think he's allergic to dust, pollen, and maybe some pets? He's always talking about how his allergies act up during certain times of the year, like when the pollen count is high. And I've seen him sneeze and get congested when we're around cats or dogs. But like I said, he takes that Claritin or something similar to help manage it. He's also mentioned being allergic to some medications, but I don't know which ones specifically. He's always been careful about what he takes and makes sure to read the labels, but I don't have all the details. *looks at the patient, concerned* Is that important for what's going on with him now?
||
Coworker: Actually, yes. He's a truck driver, so he's always on the road. He just got back from a trip to the East Coast a few days ago. He drives all over the country, so he's always traveling to different places. But like I said, he just got back from a trip a few days ago, and he seemed fine when he got back. He didn't mention anything about not feeling well or having any problems during the trip. *thinks for a moment* Although, now that you mention it, he did mention that he had to drive through some pretty bad weather on the way back. Maybe that had something to do with it? *looks at the doctor hopefully* Could that be related to what's going on with him now?

Coworker: Now that you mention it, one of the guys he works with was out sick last week with some kind of viral thing. I don't know what it was, but he was coughing and sneezing all over the place. The patient was around him a few days before he got sick, but I'm not sure if that's related. We've also had some other guys in the warehouse who've been sick with colds and flu, but I don't know if the patient was around them specifically. He's always around a lot of people on the road and at the warehouse, so it's possible he could have been exposed to something. *thinks for a moment* But like I said, he's been managing his emphysema and asthma for years, so I'm not sure if that's what's going on here. This seems really severe, and it came on so suddenly... *looks at the doctor with concern*
